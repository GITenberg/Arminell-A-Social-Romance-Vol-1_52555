  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER I.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>SUNDAY SCHOOL.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Sunday-school on the ground floor of the
keeper’s cottage that stood against the church-yard,
in a piece nibbled out of holy ground.
Some old folks said this cottage had been the
church-house where in ancient days the people
who came to divine service stayed between
morning prayer and evensong, ate their mid-day
meal and gave out and received their
hebdomadal quotient of gossip. But such
days were long over, the house had been used
as a keeper’s lodge for at least a hundred
years. The basement consisted of one low
hall exactly six feet one inch from floor to
rafters. There was no ceiling between it and
the upper house—only a flooring laid on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>rafters. In pre-traditional days the men had
sat and eaten and drunk in the room above,
and the women in that below, between services,
and their horses had been stabled
where now the keeper had his kennel.</p>

<p class='c005'>The basement chamber was paved with
slabs of slate. Rats infested the lodge, they
came after the bones and biscuits left by the
dogs. The pheasants’ food was kept there,
the keeper’s wife dropped her dripping,
and the children were not scrupulous about
finishing their crusts. The rats undermined
the slates, making runs beneath the pavement
to get at the box of dog biscuits, and the
sacks of buckwheat, and the parcels of peppercorns;
consequently the slates were not firm
to walk on. Moreover, in the floor was a
sunless secret cellar, of but eighteen inches
in depth, for the reception of liquor, or laces
or silks that had not paid the excise. The
slates over this place, long disused, were infirm
and inclined to let whoever stepped on
them down.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the week the keeper’s wife washed
in the basement and slopped soapy water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>about, that ran between the slates and formed
puddles, lurking under corners, and when, on
Sunday, the incautious foot rested on an
angle of slate, the slab tilted and squirted forth
the stale unsavoury water.</p>

<p class='c005'>The room, as already said, was unceiled.
The rafters were of solid oak; the boards
above were of deal, and had shrunk in places,
and in places dropped out the core of their
knots. The keeper’s children found a pleasure
in poking sticks and fingers through, and
in lying flat on the floor with an eye on the
knot-hole, surveying through it the proceedings
in the Sunday-school below.</p>

<p class='c005'>About the floor in unsystematic arrangement
spraddled forms of deal, rubbed by boys’
trousers to a polish. Some of these forms
were high in the leg, others short. No two
were on a level, and no two were of the
same length. They were rudely set about
the floor in rhomboidal shapes, or rather in
trapeziums, which according to Euclid have
no defined shapes at all.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a large open fireplace at one
end of the room, in which in winter a fire of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>wood burned. When it burned the door had
to be left wide open, because of the smoke,
consequently Sunday-school was held in
winter in a draught. At the extremity of the
room, opposite the fireplace stood Moses and
Aaron—not in the flesh, nor even in spirit,
but in “counterfeit presentment” as large as
life, rudely painted on board. They had
originally adorned the east end of the chancel;
when, however, the fashion of restoring
churches set in, Orleigh Church had been
done up, and Moses and Aaron had been supplanted
to make room for a horrible reredos
of glazed tiles. One of the Sunday-school
scholars, a wag, had scribbled mottoes from
their mouths, on scrolls, and had made Aaron
observe to Moses, “Let us cut off our noses;”
to which the meekest of men was made to re-join,
“It is the fashion to wear ’em.” But
through orthographical weakness, fashion had
been spelled <i>fashum</i>, and wear ’em had been
rendered <i>warum</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>But why was the Sunday-school held in
the basement of the keeper’s cottage? For
the best of good reasons. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>no other room conveniently near the church
in which it could be held.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton could not live in peace
without a Sunday-school. To her, the obligation
to keep the ten commandments was
second to the obligation to keep Sunday-school.
How could the ten commandments
be taught, unless there were a Sunday-school
in which to teach them? About a century ago
Mr. Raikes invented and introduced this institution;
it spread like measles, schools multiplied
like maggots. It became an incumbus
on consciences. It was supposed to be the
panacea for all moral evil. There are still to
be found persons with childlike faith in Sunday-schools,
as there are to be found persons
who believe in spontaneous combustion and
calomel.</p>

<p class='c005'>The national school was two miles distant,
near the village. The church stood
in the grounds of Orleigh Park, and its
satellite, the Sunday-school, necessarily near it.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Yorkshire it is customary among the
lower classes at dinner, when there is meat,
to introduce first a huge and heavy slab of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>pudding, and the young people are expected
to devour a pound’s weight of this before
meat is put on their plates. It is thought,
and justly, that a grounding of leaden dough
will make their appetites less keen for roast
beef. On the same principle the disciples of
Mr. Raikes serve out Sunday-school, slabby
and heavy, to young church-folk, before
Church worship, to abate in some degree
their relish for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>There had been some difficulty about a
habitat for the Sunday-school. Lady Lamerton
had tried to hold it in the laundry of the
great house, but the children in muddy
weather had brought in so much dirt that no
laundry-work could be done in the room on
Monday till it had been scoured out. Besides—a
fearful discovery had been made,
better left to the imagination than particularized.
Suffice it to say that after this discovery
the children were banished the laundry. It
must have come from them. From whom
else could it have been derived? The laundry-maids
were Aphrodites, foam, or rather soapsud-born,
and it could not proceed from such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>as they. Some said—but nonsense—there is
no such a thing as spontaneous generation.
Pasteur has exploded that. So all the pupils,
with their prayer-books and Ancient-and-Moderns
under their arms, made an exodus,
and went for a while into an outhouse
in the stable-yard. There they did not remain
long, for the boys hid behind doors
instead of coming in to lessons, and then
dived into stables to see the horses. One of
them nearly died from drinking embrocation
for spavin, thinking it was cherry-brandy,
and another scratched his ignoble name on the
panel of one of my lord’s carriages, with a pin.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, on the complaint of the coachman, my
lord spoke out, and the Sunday scholars
again tucked their prayer-books and hymnals
under their arms, and, under the guidance of
Lady Lamerton, migrated to a settled habitation
in the basement of the keeper’s cottage.
The place was hardly commodious, but it had
its advantages-it was near the church.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton, who presided over the
Sunday-school and collected the Sunday
scholars’ club-pence, and distributed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>dreary brown-paper-covered literature that
constituted the Sunday-school lending library,
was a middle-aged lady with a thin face and
very transparent skin, through which every
vein showed. There was not much character
in her face, but it possessed a certain delicacy
and purity that redeemed it from being uninteresting.
She was—it could be read in
every feature—a scrupulously conscientious
woman, a woman strong in doing her duty,
and in that only; one whose head might be
and generally was in a profound muddle as
to what she believed, but who never for a
moment doubted as to what she should do.
She would be torn by wild horses rather than
not keep Sunday-school, and yet did not
know what to teach the children in the school
she mustered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton, seated on a green garden
chair from which the paint was much rubbed
away, had about her on three sides of an irregular
square the eldest girls of the school. The
next class to hers was taken by the Honourable
Arminell Inglett, her step-daughter, only
child of Lord Lamerton by his first wife.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Miss Inglett was very different in type
from her step-mother; a tall, handsome girl,
with dark hair cut short, like a boy’s, and
eyes of violet blue. She had a skin of the
purest olive, no rose whatever in her cheeks,
as transparent as Lady Lamerton’s, but of a
warmer tone, like the mellow of an old painting,
whereas that of her step-mother had the
freshness and crudeness of a picture from the
easel sent to the Royal Academy on the first
of May.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell differed from Lady Lamerton in
expression as completely as in type of feature
and colour. She had an unusual breadth of
brow, whereas Lady Lamerton’s forehead
was narrow. Her eyes had not that patient
gentleness that filled the dark blue orbs of
her ladyship, they were quick and sparkling.
Her lips, somewhat prominent, were full,
warm and contemptuous. She held her head
erect, with a curl of the mouth, and a contraction
of the brows, that expressed impatience
at the task on which she was engaged.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the left side of Miss Inglett sat Captain
Tubb, engaged on the illumination of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the souls of the senior boys. Captain Tubb
held no commission in the army or navy, not
even in the volunteers. He was, in fact,
only the manager of a lime-quarry in the
parish, on the estate of Lord Lamerton, but
such heads over gangs of quarry and mining
men bear among the people the courtesy-title
of captain.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Tubb was a short, pale man with
shiny face much polished, and with sandy
moustache and beard. When he was in perplexity,
he put his hand to his mouth, and
stroked his moustache, or his beard under the
chin, turned it up, and nibbled at the ends.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some folk said that the captain taught in
school so as to stand well with her ladyship,
who would speak a word for him to my lord;
but the rector thought, more charitably, he
did it for his soul’s and conscience sake.
Captain Tubb was a simple man, except in
his business, and in that he was sharp enough.
Perhaps he taught a class from mixed motives,
and thought it would help him on a bit
in both worlds.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said Lady Lamerton, “yes, Fanny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>White, go on. As the list of the canonical
books is known to you all, I require you to
learn the names of these books which, as the
sixth article says, are read for example of life
and instruction of manners; but yet are not
applied to establish any doctrine. After that
we will proceed to learn by heart the names
of the Homilies, twenty-one in all, given in
the thirty-fifth article, which are the more
important, because they are not even read
and hardly any one has a copy of them. Go
on with the uncanonical books. Third Book
of Esdras, Fourth Book of Esdras.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tobit,” whispered the timid Fanny
White, and curtsied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quite right, Tobit—go on. It is most
important for your soul’s health that you
should know what books are not canonical,
and in their sequence. What comes after
Tobit?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Judith,” faltered Fanny.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then a portion of Esther, not found in
Hebrew. What next?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wisdom,” shouted the next girl, Polly
Woodley.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“True, but do not be so forward, Polly; I
am asking Fanny White.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ecclesiasticks,” in a timid, doubtful sigh
from Fanny, who raised her eyes to the
boards above, detected an eye inspecting her
through a knot-hole, laughed, and then turned
crimson.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not sticks,” said Lady Lamerton, sweetly,
“you must say—cus.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A dead silence and great doubt fell on the
class.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, go on—cus.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then faintly from Fanny, “Please, my
lady, mother says I b’aint to swear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t mind,” exclaimed the irrepressible
Polly Woodley, starting up, and thrusting
her hand forward into Lady Lamerton’s face,
“Darn it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her ladyship fell back in her chair; the
eye was withdrawn from the hole in the floor,
and a laugh exploded upstairs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I—I didn’t mean that,” explained the
lady, “I meant, not Ecclesiastics, nor Ecclesiastes,
which is canonical, but Ecclesiasti—cus,
which is not.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Just then a loud, rolling, grinding sound
made itself heard through the school-room,
drowning the voices of the teachers and
covering the asides of the taught.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear me,” said Lady Lamerton, “there
is the keeper’s wife rocking the cradle again.
One of you run upstairs and ask her very
kindly to desist. It is impossible for any one
to hear what is going on below with that
thunder rolling above.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please, my lady,” said Polly, peeping up
through the nearest knot in the superjacent
plank, “it b’aint Mrs. Crooks, it be Bessie
as is rocking of the baby. Wicked creetur
not to be at school.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It does not matter who rocks the cradle,”
said her ladyship, “nor are we justified in
judging others. One of you—not all at once—you,
Polly Woodley, ask Bessie to leave
the cradle alone till later.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The whole school listened breathlessly as
the girl went out, tramped up the outside
slate steps to the floor occupied by the
keeper’s family above, and heard her say:—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now then, Bessie! What be you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>a-making that racket for? My lady says
she’ll pull your nose unless you stop at once.
My lady’s doing her best to teach us to cuss
downstairs, and her can’t hear her own voice
wi’out screeching like a magpie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then up rose Lady Lamerton in great
agitation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That girl is intolerable. She shall not
have a ticket for good conduct to-day. I
will go—no, you run, Joan Ball, and make
her return. I will have a proper school-room
built. This shall not occur again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Captain Tubb rose to his full height,
stood on a stool, put his mouth to the orifice
in the plank, placed his hands about his
mouth and roared through the hole: “Her
ladyship saith Come down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently with unabashed self-satisfaction
Polly Woodley reappeared.</p>

<p class='c005'>“When I send you on an errand,” said
Lady Lamerton severely, “deliver it as
given. I am much displeased.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, my lady, thank you,” answered
Polly with cheerful face, and resumed her
seat in class.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“Now boys,” said Captain Tubb to his
class, which was composed of the senior male
scholars, including Tom Metters, the rascal
who had put the inscriptions in the mouths of
Moses and Aaron. “Now boys, attention.
The cradle and Polly Woodley are nothing
to you. We will proceed with what we were
about.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please, sir,” said Tom Metters, thrusting
forth his hand as a semaphore, “what do
Quinquagesima, Septuagesima and the lot of
they rummy names mean?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rummy,” reproved Captain Tubb, “is an
improper term to employ. Say, remarkable.
Quinquagesima”—he stroked his moustache,
then brightened—“it is the name of a Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know, sir, but why is it so called?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why are <i>you</i> called Tom Metters?”
asked the captain as a feeble effort to turn the
tables.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I be called Tom after my uncle, and
Metters is my father’s name—but Quinquagesima?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quin-qua-gess-im-a!” mused the Captain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and looked furtively towards my lady for help,
but she was engrossed in teaching her class
what books were not to be employed for the
establishment of doctrine, and did not notice
the appeal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sir,” persisted Metters, holding him
as a ferret holds the throat of a rabbit, “Quinquagesima.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think,” said Tubb eagerly, “we were
engaged on David’s mighty men. Go on with
the mighty men.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, please sir, I <i>do</i> want to know about
Quinquagesima, cruel bad.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quin-qua-gess-ima,” sighed Capt. Tubb,
nibbling the ends of his beard; then again in
a lower sigh, “Quin-qua-gess-ima?” He
looked at Arminell for enlightenment, but in
vain. She was listening amused and scornful.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gessima—gessima!” said Mr Tubb;
then falteringly: “It’s a sort of creeper, over
veranders.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He saw a flash in Arminell’s eye, and took
it as encouragement. Then, with confidence
he advanced.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Metters, it means that this is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Sunday or week whereabouts the yaller jessamine—or
in Latin, gessima—do begin to
bloom.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, sir—and Septuagesima?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That,” answered the captain with great
promptitude, “that is when the white ’un
flowers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, sir, there’s another Sunday collick,
Sexagesima. There’s no red or blue jessamine,
be there?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Red, or blue!” The teacher looked
hopelessly at Arminell, who with compressed
lips observed him and shook her head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sex—sex—sex,” repeated Mr. Tubb,
with his mouth full of beard, “always means
females. That means the female jessamine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Be there any, sir? There’s a petticoat
narcissus, and a lady’s smock, and a marygold,
but I never heard of a she-jessamine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are none here,” answered Tubb,
“but in the Holy Land—lots.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Really, Arminell,” said Lady Lamerton,
“your class is doing nothing but play and disturb
mine.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“I am on the stool of the learner,” sneered
the girl.</p>

<p class='c005'>At that moment, through the ceiling, or
rather boards above, dropped a black-handled
kitchen fork within a hair’s breadth of Arminell’s
head. She drew back, startled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it? What is the matter?” exclaimed
Lady Lamerton. “Run up, Polly
Woodley!—no, not you this time; you, Fanny
White, and see what they are about upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please, my lady,” said Polly, peering into
the higher regions through the hole, “Bessie
have given the baby the knives and forks to
play with, ’cause you wont let her rock the
cradle, and to keep ’un from crying. He’s a
shoving ’em through the floor.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, down through the knot-hole descended
a shower of comfits. The child had been
given a cornet by its mother, and had eagerly
opened it, over the hole where it had poked
the fork.</p>

<p class='c005'>The school floor was overspread with a
pink and white hail-shower. In a moment,
all order was over. The classes broke up
into individual units, all on the floor, kicking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>scratching, elbowing, grabbing after the
scattered comfits, thrusting fingers into eyes,
into soapy water; getting them trodden on,
nipped between slates, a wriggling, contending,
greedy, noisy tangle of small humanity,
and above it stood my lady protesting, and
Captain Tubb nibbling the ends of his sandy
beard, and looking dazed; and Arminell Inglett,
half angry, half amused, altogether contemptuous.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There!” exclaimed Lady Lamerton, “the
bells are going for divine service. In places
at once—Let us pray!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER II.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>A FOLLOWER.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The church bells were ringing, the Sunday-school
had at last been reduced to order,
arranged in line, and wriggled, sinuous, worm-like,
along the road and up the avenue to the
church porch. Lady Lamerton, brandishing
her sunshade as a field-marshal’s baton, kept
the children in place, and directed the head
of the procession.</p>

<p class='c005'>But with what heart-burnings, what envies,
what excited passions did that train sweep on
its way. Some of the children had got more
comfits than others, and despised those less
favoured by luck, and others comfitless envied
the more successful. Polly Woodley had
secured more comfits than the rest, and had
them screwed in the corner of her pocket-handkerchief,
and she thrust it exultantly
under the eyes of Fanny White, who had
come off with one only.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Some sobbed because they had crumpled
their gowns, one boy howled because in stooping
he had ruptured his nether garments, Joan
Ball had broken the feather in her hat, and
revenged herself on her neighbour by a stab
of pin. One child strewed its tongue with
comfits, and when Lady Lamerton did not
observe, exposed its tongue to the rest of the
children to excite their envy. Another was
engaged in wiping out of its eyes the soapy
water that in the scuffle had been squirted into
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Tubb dropped away at the church
gates to shake hands with, and talk to, some
of the villagers, the inn-keeper to the Lamerton
Arms, the churchwarden, the guardian of
the poor, and the miller, men who constituted
the middle crumb of the parochial loaf.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton likewise deserted her
charges at the porch, and having consigned
them to the clerk, returned on her course,
entered the drive, and proceeded to meet his
lordship, that they might make their solemn
entrance into church together. Arminell had
disappeared.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Where is the girl?” asked her ladyship
when she took my lord’s arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Haven’t seen her, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Really, Lamerton,” said my lady, “she
frightens me. She is so impulsive and self-willed.
She flares up when opposed, and has
no more taste for Sunday-school than I have
for oysters. I do my best to influence her for
good, but I might as well try to influence a
cocoa-nut. By the way, Lamerton, you
really must build us a Sunday-school, the
inconveniences to which we are subjected are
intolerable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you seen Legassick, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe he is standing by the steps.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I must speak to him about the road, it
has been stoned recently. Monstrous! It
should have been metalled in the winter, then
the stones would have worked in, now they
will be loose all the summer to throw down
the horses.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you will build us a Sunday-school?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will see about it. Won’t the keeper’s
lodge do? The woman does not wash downstairs
on a Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“I wish you kept school there one Sabbath
day. You would discover how great are the
discomforts. Now we are at the church
gates and must compose our minds.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly, my dear. The lord-lieutenant
is going to make Gammon sheriff.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why Gammon?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because he can afford to pay for the
honour. The old squirearchy can’t bear the
expense.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hush, we are close to the church, and
must withdraw our minds from the world.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I will, dear. Eggin’s pigs have been
in the garden again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’ll be the exhortation to-day,
Lamerton, and you must stand up for it.
Next Sunday is Sacrament Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To be sure. I’ll have a lower line of wire
round the fences. Those pigs go where a
hare will run.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you brought your hymnal with
you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton fumbled in his pocket, and
produced his yellow silk kerchief and a book
together.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“That,” said his wife, “is no good; it is
the old edition.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It doesn’t matter. I will open the book,
and no one will be the wiser.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you will be thinking during the hymn
of Eggin’s pigs and Gammon’s sheriffalty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll do better next Sunday. The
gardener tells me they have turned up your
single dahlias.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hush! we are in the church. Arminell
is not in the pew. Where can she be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was not in church. She was, in
fact, walking away from it, and by the time
her father had entered his pew and looked
into his hat, had put a distance of half a mile
between herself and the sacred building. A
sudden fit of disgust at the routine of Sunday
duties had come over her, and she resolved
to absent herself that morning from church,
and pay a visit to a deserted lime quarry, where
she could spend an hour alone, and her moral
and religious sense, as she put it, could recover
tone after the ordeal of Sunday-school.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What can induce my lady to take a class
every Sunday?” questioned Arminell in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>thought. “It does no good to the children,
and it maddens the teachers. But, oh! what
a woman mamma is! Providence must have
been hard up for ideas when it produced my
lady. How tiresome!”</p>

<p class='c005'>These last words were addressed to a
bramble that had caught in her skirt. She
shook her gown impatiently and walked on.
The bramble still adhered and dragged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a nuisance,” said Arminell, and she
whisked her skirt round and endeavoured to
pick off the brier, but ineffectually.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me assist you,” said a voice; and in
a moment a young man leaped the park wall,
stepped on the end of the bramble, and said,
“Now, if you please, walk on, Miss Inglett.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell took a few steps and was free.
She turned, and with a slight bow said, “I
thank you, Mr. Saltren.” Then, with a
smile, “I wish I could get rid of all tribulations
as easily.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And find them whilst they cling as light.
You are perhaps not aware that ‘tribulation’
derives from the Latin <i>tribulus</i>, a bramble.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So well aware was I that I perpetrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the joke which you have spoiled by threshing
it. Why are you not at church, Mr. Saltren,
listening for the rector’s pronunciation of the
Greek names of St. Paul’s acquaintances, in
the hopes of detecting a false quantity among
them?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because Giles has a cold, and I stay at
my lady’s desire to read the psalms and
lessons to him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder whether schooling Giles is as
intolerable as taking Sunday class; if it be,
you have my grateful sympathy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your sympathy, Miss Inglett, will relieve
me of many a tribulus which adheres to my
robe.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is Giles a stupid boy and troublesome
pupil?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all. My troubles are not connected
with my little pupil.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Class-taking in that Sunday-school is a
sort of mental garrotting,” said Arminell. “I
wonder whether a teacher always feels as if
his brains were being measured for a hat
when he is giving instruction.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only when there is non-receptivity in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the minds of those he teaches, or tries to
teach. May I ask if you are not going to
church, Miss Inglett?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have done the civil by attending the
Sunday-school, and the articles disapprove of
works of supererogation. I am going to
worship under the fresh green leaves, and to
listen to the choir of the birds—blackbird,
thrush, and ouzel. I am too ruffled in temper
to sit still in church and listen to the same
common-places in the same see-saw voice
from the pulpit. Do you know what it is to
be restless, Mr. Saltren, and not know what
makes you ill at ease? To desire greatly
something, and not know what you long
after?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The young man was walking beside her,
a little in the rear, respectfully, not full
abreast. He was a pale man with an oval
face, dark eyes and long dark lashes, and a
slight downy moustache.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can in no way conceive that anything
can be lacking to Miss Inglett,” he said.
“She has everything to make life happy, an
ideally perfect lot, absolutely deficient in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>every element that can jar with and disturb
tranquillity and happiness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You judge only by exterior circumstances.
You might say the same of the bird in the
egg—it fits it as a glove, it is walled
round by a shell against danger, it is warmed
by the breast of the parent, why should it be
impatient of its coiled up, comatose condition?
Simply because that condition is
coiled up and comatose. Why should the
young sponge ever detach itself from the
rock on which it first developed by the side
of the great absorbent old sponge? It gets
enough to eat, it is securely attached by its
foot to the rock; it is in the oceanic level
that suits its existence. Why should it let
go all at once and float away, rise to the
surface and cling elsewhere? Because of the
monotony of its life of absorption and contraction,
and of its sedentary habits. But,
there,—enough about myself; I did not intend
to speak of myself. You have brambles
clinging to you. Show me them, that I may
put my foot on them and free you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know, Miss Inglett, who I am—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>son of the captain of the manganese mine,
and that his wife is an old lady’s maid from
the park. You know that I was a clever
boy, and that his lordship most generously
interested himself in me, and when it was
thought I was consumptive, sent me for a
couple of winters to Mentone. You know
that he provided for my schooling, and sent
me to the University, and then most kindly
took me into Orleigh as tutor to your half-brother
Giles, till I can resolve to enter the
Church, when, no doubt, he will some day
give me a living. All that you know. Do
not suppose I am insensible to his lordship’s
kindness, when I say that all this goodness
shown me has sown my soul full of brambles,
and made me the most miserable of men.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But how so?” Miss Inglett looked at
him with unfeigned surprise. “As you said
to me, so say I to you, and excuse the freedom.
Mr. Saltren has everything to make
life happy, education, comfortable quarters,
kind friends, an assured future, an ideally
perfect lot, absolutely deficient in disturbing
elements.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“Now you judge by the outside. I admit
to the full that Lord Lamerton has done
everything he could think of to do me good,
but can one man calculate what will suit
another? Will a bog plant thrive in loam,
or a heath in clay?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You do not think that what has been done
for you is well done?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not inclined for the Church, I have
a positive distaste for the ministry, and yet
Lord Lamerton is bent on my being a parson.
If I do not become one, what am I to be? I
cannot go back to the life whence I have been
taken; I cannot endure to be with those who
hold their knives by the middle when eating,
and drink their tea out of their saucers, and
take their meals in their shirt sleeves. Remember
I have been translated from the
society to which by birth I belong, to another
as different from it as is that of Brahmins from
Esquimaux; I cannot accommodate myself
again to what was once my native element.
Baron Munchausen, in one of his voyages,
landed on an island made of cream cheese,
and only discovered it by the fainting of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>sailor who had a natural antipathy to cream
cheese. I have come ashore on an island the
substance of which is altogether different from
the soil where I was born. I cannot say I
have an ineradicable distaste for it, but that
at first I found a difficulty in walking on it.
The specific gravity of cream cheese is other
than that of clay. Now that I have acquired
the light and trippant tread that suits, if I
return to my native land, my paces will be
criticised, and regarded as affected, and myself
as supercilious, for not at once plodding
from my shoulders like a ploughboy in marl.
How was it with poor Persephone who spent
half her time in the realm of darkness and
half in that of light? She carried to the world
of light her groping tentative walk, and was
laughed at, and when in Hades, she trod
boldly as if in day and got bruises and bloody
noses. Even now I am in a state of oscillation
between the two spheres, and am at home in
neither, miserable in both. When I am in
the cream-cheese island I never feel that I can
walk with the buoyancy of one born on cream-cheese.
I can never quite overcome the sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of inhaling an atmosphere of cheese, never
quite find the buttermilk squeezed out of it
taste like aniseed water.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell could not refrain from a laugh.
“Really, Mr. Saltren, you are not complimentary
to our island.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Call it the Isle of Rahat la Koum, Turkish
Delight, or Guava Jelly—anything luscious.
One who has eaten salt pork and
supped vinegar cannot at once tutor his palate
to everything saccharine to a syrup.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what really troubles you in the Isle
of Guava?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not a native but a stranger. Your
tongue is by me acquired. There are even
tones and inflexions of voice in you I cannot
attain because my vocal organs got set in
another world. A man like myself taken up
and carried into a different sphere by another
hand is inevitably so self-conscious that his
self-consciousness is a perpetual torment to
him. According to the apocryphal tale, an
angel caught Habakkuk by the hair and
carried him with a mess of pottage in his
hands through the air, and deposited him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Daniel’s den of lions. Your father has been
my angel, who has taken me up and transported
me, and now I am in a den of lordly
beasts who stalk round me and wonder how I
came among them, and turn up their noses at
the bowl I carry in my shaking hands.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you want to escape from us
lions?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pardon me—I am equally ill at ease elsewhere,
I have associated with lions till I can
only growl.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And lash yourself raw,” laughed Arminell;
“you know a lion has a nail at the end of his
tail, wherewith he goads himself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can torture myself—that is true,” said
Saltren, in a disquieted tone. “My lord will
give me a living and provide for me if I will
enter the Church, but that is precisely an
atmosphere I do not relish—and what
am I to do? I cannot dig, to beg I am
ashamed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Saltren, you are not at ease in the
lions’ den, but suppose you were to crawl out
and get into the fields?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should lose my way, having been carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>by the angel out of my own country. You
see the wretchedness of my position, I am
uncomfortable wherever I am. In my present
situation I imagine slights. Anecdotes told
at table make me wince, jokes fret me. Conversation
on certain subjects halts because I
am present. Yet I cannot revert to my native
condition; that would be deterioration, now I
have acquired polish, and have progressed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should not have supposed, Mr. Saltren,
that you were so full of trouble.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No—looking on a rose-pip, all smoothness,
you do not reckon on its being full of choke
within. And now—Miss Inglett, you see at
once an instance of my lack of tact and knowledge.
I am in doubt whether I have done
well to pour out my pottle of troubles in your
ear, or whether I have behaved like a
booby.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I invited you to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Precisely, but in the language of the Isle
of Guava, words do not mean what they are
supposed to mean in the Land of Bacon. I
may have transgressed those invisible bounds
which you recognise by an instinct of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>I am deficient. There are societies which
have laws and signs of fellowship known only
to the initiated. You belong to one, the
great Freemasonry of Aristocratic Culture.
You all know one another in it, how—is inconceivable
to me, though I watch and puzzle
to find the symbol; and your laws, unwritten,
I can only guess at, but you all know them,
suck them in with mother’s milk. I have
been brought up among you, but I have only
an idea of your laws, and as for your shibboleth—it
escapes me altogether. And now—I do
not know whether I have acted rightly or
wrongly in telling you how I am situated. I
am in terror lest in taking you at your word I
may not have grossly offended you, and lest
you be now saying in your heart, What an
unlicked cub this is! how ignorant of tact, how
lacking in good breeding! He should have
passed off my invitation with a joke about
brambles. He bores me, he is insufferable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I assure you—Mr. Saltren——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Excuse my interrupting you. It may,
or may not be so. I dare say I am hypersensitive,
over-suspicious.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“And now, Mr. Saltren, I think Giles is
waiting for his psalms and lessons.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean—I have offended you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all. I am sorry for you, but I
think you are—excuse the word—morbidly
sensitive.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You cannot understand me because you
have never been in my land. Baron Munchausen
says that in the moon the aristocrats
when they want to know about the people
send their heads among them, but their
trunks and hearts remain at home. The
heads go everywhere and return with a report
of the wants, thoughts and doings of the
common people. You are the same. You
send your heads to visit us, to enquire about
us, to peep at our ways, and search out our
goings, but you do not understand us, because
you have not been heart and body
down to finger-ends and toes among us, and
of us—you cannot enter into our necessities
and prejudices and gropings. But I see, I
bore you. In the tongue of the Isle of
Guava you say to me, Giles wants his psalms
and lessons. Which being interpreted means,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>This man is a bramble sticking to my skirts,
following, impeding my movements, a drag,
a nuisance. I must get rid of him. I wish
you a good morning, Miss Inglett; and holy
thoughts under the greenwood tree!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Arminell Inglett made the best of her was
to the old quarry. She was impatient to be
alone, to enjoy the beautiful weather, the
spring sights and sound, to recover the
elasticity of spirit of which she had been
robbed by Sunday-school.</p>

<p class='c005'>But would she recover that elasticity after
her conversation with the young tutor?
What he had said was true. He was a village
lad of humble antecedents who had been
taken up by her father because he was intelligent
and pleasing, and commended by
the schoolmaster, and delicate. Lord and
Lady Lamerton were ever ready to do a
kindness to a tenant or inhabitant of Orleigh.
When any of the latter were sick, they received
jellies and soups and the best port
wine from the park; and a deserving child in
school received recognition, and a steady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>youth was sure of a helping hand into a good
situation.</p>

<p class='c005'>More than ordinary favor had been shown
to this young man, son of Stephen Saltren,
captain of the manganese mine. He had
been lifted out of the station in which he had
been born, and was promoted to be the instructor
of Giles. Arminell had always
thought her father’s conduct towards him
extraordinarily kind, and now her eyes were
open to see that it had been a cruel kindness,
filling the young man’s heart with a bitterness
that contended with his gratitude.</p>

<p class='c005'>It would have been more judicious perhaps
had Lord Lamerton sent young Jingles
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jingles, it must be explained, was not the
tutor’s Christian name. He had been baptised
out of compliment to his lordship, Giles
Inglett, and Giles Inglett Saltren was his
complete name. But in the national school
his double Christian name had been condensed,
not without a flavour of spite, into
Jingles, and at Orleigh he would never be
known by any other.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The old lime-quarry lay a mile from the
park. It was a picturesque spot, and would
have been perfectly beautiful but for the
heaps of rubbish thrown out of it which took
years to decay, and which till decayed were
unsightly. The process had, however, begun.
Indeed, as the quarry had been worked
for a century prior to its abandonment, a
good deal of the “ramp,” as such rubbish
heaps are locally called, was covered with
grass and pines.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton had done his best to disguise
the nakedness by plantations of Scotch,
larch and spruce, which took readily to the
loose soil, the creeping roots grasped the
nodes of stone and crushed them as in a vice,
then sucked out of them the nutriment
desired; the wild strawberry rioted over the
banks, and the blackberry brambles dropped
their trailers over the slopes, laden in autumn
with luscious fruit, and later, when flowers
are scarce with frost-touched leaves, carmine,
primrose, amber and purple.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the back of the quarry was an old wood,
sloping to the south and breaking off sharply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>at the precipice where the lime rock had been
cut away; this was a wood of oaks with an
undergrowth of bracken and male fern, and
huge hollies. Here and there large venerable
Scotch pines rose above the rounded
surface of the oak tops, in some places singly,
elsewhere in dark clumps.</p>

<p class='c005'>The rock of the hill was slaty. The strata
ran down and made a dip and came to the
surface again, and in the lap lay the limestone.
When the quarry-men had deserted
the old workings, water came in and partly
filled it, to the depth of forty feet, with crystalline
bottle-green water. Lord Lamerton had
put in trout, and the fish grew there to a great
size, but were too wary to be caught. The
side of the quarry to the south shelved rapidly
into the water, and the fisherman standing
on the slope with his rod was visible to the
trout. They were too cautious to approach,
and too well fed with the midges that hovered
over the water to care to bite.</p>

<p class='c005'>The north face of the quarry—that is the
face that looked to the sun—was quite precipitous;
it rose to the same height above the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>water that it descended beneath it. Over the
edge hung bushes of may that wreathed the
gray rocks in spring with snow as of the past
winter, and in winter with scarlet berries,
reminiscences of the fire of lost summer.
Where the may-bushes did not monopolise
the top, there the heath and heather hung
their wiry branches and grew to brakes, and
the whortleberry—the vaccinium—formed a
fringe of glossy leafage in June and July rich
with purple berries, and in autumn dotted
with fantastic scarlet, where a capricious leaf
had caught a touch of frost that had spared
its fellows.</p>

<p class='c005'>Down a rocky cranny fell a dribbling
stream, the drainage of the wood above; in
summer it was but a distillation, sufficient to
moisten the beds of moss and fern that rankly
grew on the ledges beneath it, and in winter
never attaining sufficient volume to dislodge
the vegetation it nourished.</p>

<p class='c005'>To the ledges thus moistened choice ferns
had retreated as to cities of refuge from the
rapacity of collectors, who rive away these
delicate creatures regardless what damage is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>done them, indifferent whether they kill in
the process, considering only the packing of
them off in hampers for sale or barter, and in
many places exterminating the rarest and
most graceful ferns; but here, with a gulf of
deep water between themselves and their
pursuers, the parsley and maiden-hair ferns
throve and tossed their fronds in security and
insolence.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was marvellous to see how plants luxuriated
in this old abandoned quarry, how they
seized on it, as squatters on no-man’s land,
and multiplied and grew wanton and revelled
there; how the harts tongue grew there to
enormous size, and remained, unbrowned by
frost, throughout the winter; how the crane’s
bill bloomed to Christmas, and scented the
air around, and the strawberry fruited out of
season and reason.</p>

<p class='c005'>By what fatality did the butterflies come
there in such numbers? Was it that they
delighted in dancing over the placid mirror
admiring themselves therein? After a few
gyrations they inevitably dipped their wings
and were lost; perhaps they mistook their gay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>reflections for inviting flowers, or perhaps
like Narcissus, they fell in love with their own
likenesses, and, stooping to kiss, were caught.</p>

<p class='c005'>In summer butterflies were always to be
found hovering over or floating on the surface,
but they hovered or floated only for a while,
presently a ring was formed in the glassy
surface, a ring that widened and multiplied
itself—the butterfly was gone, and a trout the
better for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>About six feet of soil, in some places more,
in others less, appeared in sections above the
quarry-edge, that is to say, above the rock. It
was quite possible to trace the primitive surface
of the pre-historic earth, much indented;
but these indentations had been filled in by
accumulations of humus, so that the upper
turf was almost of a level.</p>

<p class='c005'>Where rock ended and soil began, the jackdaws
had worked for themselves caves and
galleries in which they lived a communal life,
and multiplied prodigiously. A pair of hawks
bred there as well, spared by express order of
Lord Lamerton, but viewed with bitter animosity
by the keepers; also a colony of white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>owls, all on tolerable terms, keeping their
distances, avoiding social intercourse, very
much like the classes among mankind.
These owls also would have perished, nailed
to the stable doors or the keeper’s wall, had
not his lordship extended protection to them
likewise. The kingfishers in the Ore were becoming
fewer, the keepers waged war on them
also, because they interfered with the fish.
Lord Lamerton did not know this, or he would
have held his protecting hand over their
amethystine heads.</p>

<p class='c005'>The cliff was ribbed horizontally, the
harder bands of stratification standing forth
as shelves on which lodged the crumbling of
the more friable beds, and the leaves that
sailed down from the autumn trees above.
On these ledges a few bushes and a stunted
Scotch pine grew. The latter grappled with
the rock, holding to it with its red-brown roots
like the legs of a gigantic spider.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the west end, on a level with the topmost
shelf of rock, just beneath where the
earth buried the surface of rock, was a cave
artificially constructed, at the time when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>lime was worked, as a refuge for the miners
when blasting.</p>

<p class='c005'>Formerly a path had existed leading to this
cave, but now the path was gone—scarce a
trace survived. The owls, calculating on the
inaccessibility of the grot to man, had taken
possession of it, and bred there.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am glad I came here,” said Arminell.
“In this lovely, lonely spot one can worship
God better than in a stuffy church, pervaded
with the smell of yellow-soap, of clean linen,
and the bergamot of oiled heads, and the
peppermint the clerk sucks. Here one has
the air full of the incense of the woods, the
pines exuding resin in the sun, the oak-leaves
exhaling their aroma, and the ferns, fragrant
with a sea-like stimulating odour. I am
weary of that hum-drum which constitutes to
mamma the law and aim of life. We may be
all—as Jingles says—steeped in syrup, but it
is the syrup of hum-drum that crystallizes
about us, after having extracted from us and
dismissed all individual flavour, like the candied
fruit in a box, where currants, greengage,
apricot, pear—all taste alike. We are so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>saturated with the same syrup that we all
lead the same saccharine existences, have the
same sweet thoughts, utter the same sugary
words, and have not an individualizing smack
and aroma among us. Mamma is the very
incarnation of routine. She talks to her guests
on what she thinks will interest them, got up
for the occasion out of magazines and reviews.
These magazines save her and the like of her
a world of trouble. The aristocrats of the
moon, according to Jingles, sent their heads
forth in pursuit of knowledge; we have other
peculiar heads sent to us stuffed with the
forced meat of knowledge, and wrapped in
the covers of magazines. So much for my
mother. As for my father, he neither takes
in nor gives vent to ideas. He presents
prizes at schools, opens institutes, attends
committees, sits on boards, presides at banquets;
occasionally votes, but never speaks
in the House; his whole circle of interests is
made up of highways, asylums and county
bridges. In olden times, witches drew circles
and set about them skulls and daggers, toads,
and braziers, and within these circles wrought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>necromancy. My father’s circle is that of hum-drum,
set round with county and parochial
institutions, with the sanitary arrangements
carefully considered, and without the magic
circle he works—nothing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She was standing at the west end of the
quarry, looking along the edge of the precipice,
on her left.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder,” she mused, “whether it would
be feasible to reach the owls.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Filled with this new ambition, she thought
no more of the shortcomings of her father and
step-mother.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It would be possible, by keeping a cool
head,” she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should like to see what an owl’s nest is
like, and in that cave I can pay my Sunday
devotions.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The shelf was not broad enough to allow
of any one walking on it unsupported, even
with a cool head.</p>

<p class='c005'>In places, indeed, it broadened, and there
lay a cushion of grass, but immediately it
narrowed to a mere indication. The distance
was not great, from whence Arminell stood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>to the cave, some twenty-five feet, and a slip
would entail a fall into the water beneath.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the girl stood considering the possibilities
and the difficulties, she noticed that
streamers of ivy hung over the edge from the
surface of the soil. She could not reach these,
however, from where she stood. Were she
to lay hold of them, she might be able to
sustain herself whilst stepping along the ledge,
just as if she were supported by a pendent rope.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe it is contrivable,” she said,“I
see where the ivy springs at the root of an
elder tree. I can find or cut a crooked stick,
and thus draw the strands to me. How angry
and indignant mamma would be, were she to
see what I am about.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She speedily discovered a suitable stick,
and with its assistance drew the pendent
branches towards her. Then, laying hold of
them, she essayed an advance on the shelf.
The ivy-ropes were tough, and tenacious in
their rooting into the ground. She dragged
at them, jerked them, and they did not yield.
She grasped them in her left hand, and
cautiously stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>At first she had a ledge of four inches in
width to rest her feet on, but the rock, though
narrow, was solid, and by leaning her weight
well on the ivy, and advancing on the tips of
her feet, she succeeded, not without a flutter
of heart, in passing to a broad patch of turf,
where she was comparatively safe, and where,
still clinging to the ivy, she drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='c005'>The water, looked down on from above,
immediately beneath her was blue; only in
the shadows, where it did not reflect the light,
was it bottle-green.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was not a ripple on it. She had not
dislodged a stone. She turned her eyes up
the bank. She had no fear of the ropes failing
her; they would not be sawn through,
because they swung over friable earth, not
jagged rock.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Allons, avançons,” said Arminell, with a
laugh. She was excited, pleased with herself—she
had broken out of the circle of
humdrum.</p>

<p class='c005'>The ledge was wide, where she stood, and
she held to the rope to keep her from giddiness,
rather than to sustain her weight.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>After a few further steps, she paused.
The shelf failed altogether for three feet, but
beyond the gap was a terrace matted with
cistus and ablaze with flower. Arminell’s
first impulse was to abandon her enterprise
as hazardous beyond reason, but her second
was to dare the further danger, and make a
spring to the firm ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is the difference between me and
my lady,” said Arminell. “She—and my
lord likewise—will not risk a leap—moral,
social, or religious.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then with a rush of impetuosity and impatience,
she swung herself across the gap,
and landed safely on the bed of cistus.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Would Giles ever be permitted the unconventional?”
asked Arminell. “What a
petit-maître he will turn out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Hon. Giles Inglett, her half-brother,
aged ten, was, as already said, the only son
of Lord Lamerton and heir-apparent to the
barony.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the cistus patch she crept, still clinging
to the ivy, along the ledge that now bore
indications of the path once formed on it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>presently, with a sense of defiance of danger,
allowed herself to look down into the still water.</p>

<p class='c005'>“After all, if I did go down, it would not
be very dreadful—it is a reversed heaven. I
would spoil my gown, but what of that? I
have my allowance, and can spoil as many
gowns as I choose within my margin. I
wonder—would a fall from my social terrace
be as easy as one from this—and lead to
such trifling and reparable consequences?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then she reached the platform of the cave,
let go the ivy-streamers, and entered the grotto.</p>

<p class='c005'>The entrance was just high enough for
Arminell to pass in without stooping. The
depth of the cave was not great, ten feet.
The sun shone in, making the nook cheerful and
warm. Again Arminell looked down at the pond.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How different the water seems according
to the position from which we look at it.
Seen from one point it blazes with reflected
light, and laughs with brilliance; seen from
another it is infinitely sombre, light-absorbing,
not light-reflecting. It is so perhaps with
the world, and poor Jingles contemplates it
from an unhappy point.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>She seated herself on the floor at the
mouth of the cave, and leaned her back
against the side, dangling one foot over the
edge of the precipice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The best of churches, the most inspiring
shrine for holy thoughts—O, how lucky, I
have in my pocket Gaboriau’s ‘Gilded
Clique!’”</p>

<p class='c005'>She wore a pretty pink dress with dark
crimson velvet trimmings, but the brightest
point of colour about Arminell was the blood-coloured
cover of the English version of the
French romance of rascality and crime.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell had lost her mother at an age at
which she could not remember her. The
girl had been badly brought up, by governesses
unequal to the task of forming the
mind and directing the conscience of a self-willed
intelligent girl.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had changed her governesses often,
and not invariably for the better. One indulged
and flattered her, and set her cap at
Lord Lamerton. She had to be dismissed.
Then came a methodical creature, eminently
conscientious, so completely a piece of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>animated clockwork, so incapable of acting or
even thinking out of a set routine, that she
drove Arminell into sullen revolt. After her
departure, a young lady from Girton arrived,
who walked with long strides, wore a pince-nez,
was primed with slang, and held her
nose on high to keep her pince-nez in place.
She was dismissed because she whistled, but
not before her influence, the most mischievous
of all, had left its abiding impress on the
character of the pupil.</p>

<p class='c005'>This governess laughed at conventionalities,
such as are the safeguards of social life, and
sneered at the pruderies of feminine modesty.
Her tone was sarcastic and sceptical.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then came a young lady of good manners,
but of an infinitely feeble mind, who wore a
large fringe to conceal a forehead as retreating
as that of the Neanderthal man.
Arminell found her a person of infinite
promise and no achievement. She undertook
to teach Greek, algebra, and comparative
anatomy, but could not spell “rhododendron.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When Lord Lamerton had married again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the new wife shrank from exercising authority
over the wayward girl, and sought to draw
her to her by kindness. But Arminell
speedily gauged the abilities of her stepmother,
and became not actively hostile, but
indifferent to her. Lady Lamerton was not
a person to provoke hostility.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus the girl had grown up with mind
unformed, judgment undisciplined, feelings
impetuous and under no constraint, and with
very confused notions of right and wrong.
She possessed by nature a strong will, and
this had been toughened by resistance where
it should have been yielded to, and non-resistance
where it ought to have been firmly
opposed.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had taken a class that Sunday in the
school, as well as on the preceding Sunday,
only at Lady Lamerton’s urgent request,
because the school-mistress was absent on a
holiday.</p>

<p class='c005'>And now Arminell, who had come to the
Owl’s Nest to pay her devotions to heaven,
performed them by reading Gaboriau’s
“Gilded Clique.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER IV.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>A PRAYER-RAFT.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>How long Arminell had been resting in her
sunny nook above the water, reading the
record of luxury, misery and vice, she did not
know, for she became engrossed in the repulsive
yet interesting tale, and the time slipped
away, unperceived.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was roused from her reading by the
thought that suddenly occurred to her, quite
unconnected with the story, that she had let
go the strands of ivy when she reached the
cave,—and in a moment her interest in the
“Gilded Clique” ceased and she became
alarmed about her own situation. In her
delight at attaining the object of her ambition,
she had cast aside the streamers without
a thought that she might need them again,
and they had reverted to their original position,
beyond her reach. She could not venture
along the strip of turf without their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>support, and she had not the crook with her,
wherewith to rake them back within reach of
her hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>What was to be done? The charm of the
situation was gone. Its novelty had ceased
to please. Her elation at her audacity in
venturing on the “path perilous” had subsided.
To escape unassisted was impossible,
and to call for assistance useless in a place so
rarely visited.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It does not much matter,” said Arminell;
“I shall not have to spend a night among the
owls. My lady when she misses me will send
out a search-party, and Jingles will direct
them whither to go for me. I will return to
my book.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Arminell could not recover her interest
in the story of the “Gilded Clique.” She was
annoyed at her lack of prudence, for it had
not only subjected her to imprisonment, but
had placed her in a position somewhat ridiculous.
She threw down the book impatiently
and bit her lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is a lesson to me,” she said, “not
to make rash excursions into unknown regions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>without retaining a clue which will enable
me to retrace my steps to the known. Cæsar
may have been a hero when he burnt his
ships, but his heroism was next akin to folly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She sat with her hands in her lap, with a
clouded face, musing on the chance of her
speedy release. Then she laughed, “Like
Jingles, I am in a wrong position, but unlike
him, I am here by my own foolhardiness.
He was carried by my lord into the eagle’s
nest. Like Sinbad, out of the valley of
diamonds. But in the valley of diamonds
there were likewise serpents. My lord
swooped down on poor Jingles, caught him up,
and deposited him in his nest on the heights
for the young eagles to pull to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As she was amusing herself with this
fancy, she observed a man by the waterside
at the east or further end of the quarry,
engaged in launching a primitive raft which
he drew out of a bed of alder. The raft consisted
of a couple of hurdles lashed together,
on which an old pig-sty or stable door was
laid. Upon this platform the man stationed
himself when the raft was adrift, and with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>long oar sculled himself into the middle of
the pond.</p>

<p class='c005'>What was his object? Had he seen
Arminell and was he coming to her assistance,
concluding that she could be rescued
in no other fashion? On further observation
Arminell convinced herself that he had not
seen her and knew nothing of her predicament
and distress.</p>

<p class='c005'>What was he about to do? To fish?</p>

<p class='c005'>No—not to fish.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the raft floated in the middle of the
tarn, the man laid down his oar, knelt on the
board and began to pray.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why——!” exclaimed the girl; “that is
Captain Saltren, Jingles’ father.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Stephen Saltren, master of the
manganese mine, was a tall man, rather gaunt
and thin, and loosely compacted at the joints,
with dark hair, high cheek-bones and large,
deeply-sunken eyes. His features were
irregular and ill cut—yet it was impossible to
look at his face without being impressed with
the thought that he was no ordinary man.
His hands, though roughened and enlarged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>by work, had long fingers, the indication of a
nervous temperament. He had, moreover,
one of those flexible voices which go far towards
making a man an orator. He was
unaware of the value of his organ, he was
devoid of skill in using it; but it was an impressive
voice when used in times of deep
emotion, thrilling those who heard it and
sweeping them into sympathy with the
speaker. His eyes were those of a mystic,
looking into a far-off sphere, esteeming the
world of sense as a veil, a painted film, disturbing,
impeding distinct vision of the sole
realities that existed in the world beyond.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was velvety softness in his dark
eyes, and gentleness in his flexible mouth,
and yet the least observant person speaking
with him could see that fire was ready to leap
out of those soft eyes on provocation, and that
the mouth could set with rigid determination
when his prejudices were touched.</p>

<p class='c005'>The forehead of the man was of unusual
height. He had become partly bald, had
shed some of the hair above the brow, and
this had given loftiness to his forehead. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>were hollows between his temples and eye-brows;
his head was lumpy and narrow. Altogether
it was an ill-balanced, but an interesting
head.</p>

<p class='c005'>The mystic, who at one time was a prominent
feature in religious life, has almost
disappeared from among us, gone utterly out
of the cultured classes, gone from among the
practical mercantile classes, going little by
little from the lower beds of life, not expelled by
education but by the materialism that penetrates
every realm of human existence. In time
the mystic will have become as extinct as the
dodo, the great auk, and the Caleb Balderstones.
But there are mystics still—especially
where there is a strain of Celtic blood, and
of this class of beings was Stephen Saltren.</p>

<p class='c005'>The captain was in trouble, and whenever
he was in trouble or unhappy he had recourse
to prayer, and he prayed with most disengagement
on his raft. He came to the quarry
when his mind was disturbed and his heart
agitated, thrust himself out from land, and
prayed where he believed himself to be unobserved
and unlikely to be interrupted.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>The cause of his unrest on this occasion
was the threat Lord Lamerton had uttered of
closing the manganese mine. This mine had
its adit, crushing mill and washing floors at
but a short distance from the great house.
About fifteen years previous, a mine had been
worked on the estate that yielded so richly,
that with the profits, Lord Lamerton had been
able to clear off some mortgages. That lode
was worked out. It had been altogether an
extraordinary one, bunching, as it is termed,
into a great mass of solid manganese, but this
bunch, when worked out, ended without a
trace of continuance. Then, as Lord Lamerton
was assured, another came to the surface
in the hill behind the mansion, and as he was
in want of money, he reluctantly permitted
the mine to be opened within a rifle shot of
his house. The workings were out of sight,
hidden by a plantation, and manganese mines
make no great heaps of unsightly deposit;
nevertheless, the mine was inconveniently
near the place. It did not yield as it had
promised, or as the experts had pretended it
promised, and Lord Lamerton had lost all hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of making money by it. The vein was followed,
but it never “bunched.” Foreign competition
affected the market, English manganese
was under-sold, and Wheal Perseverance,
as the mine was called, did not pay for
the “working.” Lord Lamerton annually
lost money on it. Then he was informed
that the lode ran under Orleigh gardens, and
promised freely to “bunch” under the
mansion. That is to say, he was asked to
allow his house to be undermined. This
decided his lordship, and he announced that
the mine must be abandoned. Bunch or no
bunch, he was not going to have his old place
tunnelled under and brought about his ears,
on the chance—the chimerical chance—of a
few thousand pounds’ worth of metal being
extracted from the rock on which it stood.</p>

<p class='c005'>To Lord Lamerton his determination
seemed right and reasonable. The land was
his. The royalties were his; the house was
his. Every man may do what he will with
his own. If he has a penny in his pocket, he
is at liberty to spend or to hoard it as he
deems best.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>But this decision of his lordship threatened
ruin or something like ruin to a good many
men who had lived on the mine, to families
whereof the father worked underground, and
the children above washing ore on the floors.
The cessation of the mining would throw all
these out of employ. It was known to the
miners that manganese mines were everywhere
unprofitable and were being abandoned.
Where then should they look for employment?</p>

<p class='c005'>It was open to bachelors to migrate to
America, but what were the married men to
do? The captain would feel the stoppage of
the mine most of all. He had kept the accounts
of the output, had paid the wages, and
sold the metal. The miners might, indeed,
take temporary work on the new line in
course of construction, but that meant a
change of life from one that was regular,
whilst living in settled homes, to a wandering
existence, to makeshift housing, separation
from their families, and to association with
demoralising and lawless companions. The
captain, however, had not this chance within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>reach. He could not migrate, because he
possessed the little house in which he lived,
together with an acre of garden ground beside
it, which his father had enclosed and reclaimed.
Moreover, he was not likely to find
work which gave him a situation of authority
and superiority. Instead of being a master
he must be content—if he found employ—to
work as a servant. Hitherto, he had engaged
and dismissed the hands, now he must become
a hand—and be glad to be one—liable
to dismissal.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was natural that the men, and especially
Saltren, should feel keenly and resent the
closing of the mine. People see things as
they affect themselves, and appreciate them
only as they relate to their own affairs. I
knew a man named Balhatchet who patented
a quack medicine which he called his Heal-all,
and this man never could be brought to see
that the Fall of Man was a disaster to
humanity, for, he argued, if there had been
no fall, then no sickness, and therefore no
place for Balhatchet’s Heal-all.</p>

<p class='c005'>According to “The Spectator,” when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>news reached London that the King of
France was dead, “Now we shall have fish
cheaper,” was the greeting the tidings evoked.
The miners were angry with the bleachers,
because they used German manganese instead
of that raised in England, and angry
with the shippers for bringing it across the
sea. But above all, at this time, they were
inclined to resent the action of Lord
Lamerton in closing the mine, for by so
doing he was, as they put it, snatching the
bread out of their hungry mouths, whilst
himself eating cake. They did not believe
that undermining the great house would disturb
its foundations. That was a mere
excuse. How could his lordship be sure that
undermining would crack his walls till he had
tried it? And—supposing they did settle,
what of that? They might be rebuilt. The
men had been told that his lordship had
painted the north wall with impenetrable,
anti-damp preparation, because on that side
of the house the paper in the rooms became
mildewed. If there was damp, what better
means of drying the house than undermining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>it? Why should his lordship send many
pounds to London for damp-excluding paint,
when by spending the money in Orleigh he
might so drain the soil through a level under
the foundations that no moisture could
possibly rise?</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton had made a great deal of
money out of the first mine. He had provided
good cottages for his tenants, the workmen,
but so much worse if they were to be
turned out of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The mine had been christened Wheal
Perseverance, and what does perseverance
mean, but going on with what is begun? If
his lordship had not intended to carry on the
mine indefinitely, he should not have called it
Wheal Perseverance. When he gave it that
name he as much as promised to keep it
going always, and to stop it now was a breach
of faith. Was it endurable that Lord
Lamerton should close the mine? Who had
put the manganese in the rock? Was it Lord
Lamerton? What had the metal been run
there for but for the good of mankind, that it
might be extracted and utilized? God had carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the lode under Orleigh Park before a
Lamerton was thought of. Was it justifiable
that one man through his aristocratic selfishness
should interfere with the public good,
should contravene the arrangements of the
Creator? In the gospel the man who hid his
talent was held up to condemnation, but here
was a nobleman who sat down upon the
talent belonging to a score of hard-working
and necessitous men, desirous of extracting
it, and refused to permit them to do what God
had commanded. Was there not a fable about
a dog in the manger? Was not his lordship
a very dog in a manger, neither using the
manganese himself, nor allowing those who
desired to dig it out to put a pick into the
ground and disturb it? Maybe there was
a “bunch” under the state drawing-room
large enough to support a score of families
for three years, the men in meat and broadcloth,
the women in velvets and jockey-club
essence. Lord Lamerton and Lady Lamerton
begrudged them these necessaries of life.
The laws of the land, no doubt, were on the
side of the nobleman, but the law of God on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>that of the labourer. The laws were imposed
on the people by a House of Lords and the
Queen, and therefore they would agitate for
the abolition of an hereditary aristocracy and
keep their hats on when next the National
Anthem was played.</p>

<p class='c005'>There were more mixed up in the matter
than his lordship. Lord Lamerton did
nothing without consulting the agent, Mr.
Macduff. The abandonment of the mine
was Macduff’s doing. The reason was
known to every one—Macduff was under the
control of his wife. Mrs. Macduff was offended
because the school children did not
curtsey and touch their caps when she drove
through the village in her victoria.</p>

<p class='c005'>The rector also had a finger in this particular
pie. He bore a spite against Captain
Saltren, because the captain was not a church-man.
Not a word had been said about
stopping the lime-quarry. Oh no! of course
not, for Captain Tubb taught in the Sunday-school.
If Stephen Saltren had taken a class,
nothing would have been said about discontinuing
the mine. Therefore the miners resolved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>to join the Liberation Society and
make an outcry for the disestablishment of the
Church.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the men argued—we will not say
reasoned, and that is no caricature of their
arguments, not reasonings, in similar cases.
The uneducated man is always a suspicious
man. He never believes in the reasons
alleged, these are disguises to hide the true
springs of action.</p>

<p class='c005'>When his lordship was told how incensed
the miners were, he made light of the matter.
Pshaw! fiddlesticks! He was not going to
have his dear old Elizabethan home in which
he was born, and which had belonged to the
Ingletts before they were peers, tumbled about
his ears like a pack of cards, just because
there was a chance of finding three ha’porth
of manganese under it. The mine had been
a nuisance for some years. The standing
up to their knees in water had been injurious
to the health of the girls, many of whom had
died of decline. Wheal Perseverance was a
bad school of morals, lads and lasses worked
together there, and necessarily in a semi-nude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>condition. The schoolmaster and the
Government Inspector had complained that
the attendance at school was bad and
irregular, for the children could earn money
on the washing floors, and did not see the fun
of sitting at desks earning nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>The miners had been a constant source of
annoyance, they were all of them poachers,
and had occasional fights with the keepers.
The presence of the miners entailed the
retention of extra keepers to protect the
game, so that in this way also the mine
proved expensive. Besides, the manganese
dirtied the stream that flowed through the
grounds, made it of a hideous tawny red
colour, and spoiled the fishing not only in it,
but in the river Ore, into which it discharged
its turbid waters.</p>

<p class='c005'>The miners were all radicals and dissenters,
and he would be glad to be rid of
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>So every question has its two sides,
equally plausible.</p>

<p class='c005'>Stephen Saltren had been from boyhood
shy, silent and self-contained. His only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>book of study was the Bible, and his imagination
was fired by its poetry and its
apocalyptic visions. His thoughts were cast
in Scriptural forms; his early companions
had nick-named him the Methodist Parson.
But Saltren had never permanently attached
himself to any denomination. The
Church was too ceremonious, he turned from
her in dislike. He rambled from sect to
sect seeking a dwelling-place, and finding
only a temporary lodging. For a while he
was all enthusiasm, and flowed with grace,
then the source of unction ran dry, and he
attributed the failure to deficiencies in the
community he had joined, left it to recommence
the same round of experiences
and encounter the same disappointments in
another. As a young man he had worked
with his father at the original mine, Wheal
Eldorado, and on his father’s death, had
continued to live in the house his father had
built on land he had appropriated. He continued
to work at Eldorado, became captain
in his father’s room, and when Eldorado
was exhausted, directed the works of Wheal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Perseverance. Every one spoke highly of
Stephen Saltren, as a steady, conscientious
man, truthful and of unimpeachable honesty.
But no one quite understood Saltren, he
made no friends, he sought none; and he
left on all with whom he came in contact,
the impression that he was a man of very
abnormal character.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whilst Adam slept, the help-mate was
formed and set by him. When he opened
his eyes, it was with a start and with something
like terror that he saw Eve at his side.
He could not but believe he was still a prey
to dreams. Ever since that first meeting
love has come as a surprise on the sons of
Adam, has come on them when least prepared
to resist its advance, and has never
been regarded in the first moment as a grave
reality.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thousands of years have rolled their
course, and love has remained unchanged,
like the rose and the nightingale, neither
developing forward to some higher form of
activity, nor degenerating to one less generous.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>The diseases pass through endless modifications,
varying in phenomena with every
generation, changing their symptoms, disguising
their nature, but the fever of love is
always one and runs the identical course.
Enthusiasts have sought to stifle it in hair-cloth,
and reduce its virulence by vaccination
with foreign matter, but it resists every
effort to subdue it. Society has attempted
to discipline it and turn it to practical ends.
But love is a fire which will consume all
bonds and snap them, and is only finally
extinguished with a handful of clay, when
the breast in which it has burnt is reduced,
ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unexpectedly, unaccountably, the fever
laid hold of Stephen Saltren. He lost his
heart to Marianne Welsh, who had been
servant at the park, a handsome girl, with
refinement of manner beyond her class.</p>

<p class='c005'>He courted her for a month. She had
left the great house for some unexplained
reason, some folks said she was a liar, and
had been dismissed because found out to be
unreliable: others said she left because she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>was so good-looking that the rest of the
maids were jealous of her and worried her
out of her situation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whilst courting Marianne, Saltren was a
charmed man. His vision of the spiritual
world became clouded, and he was not sensible
of the loss. A new world of unutterable
delight, and of ideal beauty, clothed in
rainbow colours and bathed in brilliant light,
had unfurled before him and now occupied
his perspective.</p>

<p class='c005'>The acquaintanceship led at once to
marriage. There was no delay. There was
no occasion for delay. Saltren possessed
his own house and land, and was in receipt
of a good salary. The marriage ensued;
and then another change came over Saltren.
The new world of love and beauty, so real,
faded as the mirage of the desert, disclosing
desert and dead bones.</p>

<p class='c005'>Seven months after the marriage, Marianne
became the mother of a boy, and only
Stephen knew that the son was not his own.
A cruel act of treachery had been committed.
Marianne had taken his name, not because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>she loved him, but to hide her own dishonour.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he knew how he had been deceived,
a barb entered Stephen’s heart, and he was
never after free from its rankle. A fire was
kindled in his veins that smouldered and
gnawed its way outwards, certain eventually
to flare forth in some sudden and unexpected
outbreak. He became more reserved, more
dreamy, more fantastic than before his marriage,
and more of an enigma to those with
whom he associated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let the babe be christened Giles Inglett,”
said Marianne, “that has a distinguished
sound, none of your vulgar Jacks, and
Harrys, and Bills—besides, it will be taken
as a compliment at the park, and may be of
benefit to the little fellow afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is your child, call it what you will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The boy was brought up by Stephen as
his son, none doubted the paternity. But
Saltren never kissed the infant, never showed
the child love, took no interest in the welfare
of the youth. To his wife he was cold, stern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>and formal. He allowed her to see that he
could never forgive the wrong that had been
done him.</p>

<p class='c005'>So much for the past of Captain Stephen
Saltren. Now, on this spring Sunday morning,
Arminell Inglett watched the man at his
devotions on the raft. She allowed him to
proceed with them undisturbed for some
time; but she could not spend the whole day
in the owl’s nest. Saltren must be roused
from his spiritual exercises and raptures.
He must assist her—he must surely have
ropes at his disposal, and could call men to
help in her release.</p>

<p class='c005'>She called him by name.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her call was re-echoed from the rocky
walls of the quarry. Saltren looked up,
looked about, and remained expectant, with
uplifted hands and eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, half impatiently, half angrily,
Arminell flung the crimson-covered novel of
Gaboriau far out into the air, to fall on or
near Saltren, in the hopes of directing his
attention to her position.</p>

<p class='c005'>He saw the fluttering book in the air, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>stretched forth his hands to receive it. The
book whirled about, expanded, turned over,
shut, and shot down into the pond, where it
floated one moment with its red cover upwards.
Captain Saltren was engrossed
in interest to see and to secure the book, he
sculled towards it, stooped over the water
to grasp it, lost balance, and fell forward,
and in his effort to recover the volume
and save himself from immersion, touched
it, and the book went under the raft and
disappeared.</p>

<p class='c005'>The attempt to attract attention to herself
had failed, and Arminell uttered an exclamation
of vexation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER V.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>INFECTION.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>A touch on Arminell’s shoulder made her
turn with a start. She saw behind her an old
woman who had approached along the ledge,
unobserved, supporting herself by the strands
of ivy in the same manner as herself. Arminell
had been standing leaning against the
rock, her eyes and attention occupied with
Captain Saltren, and so had not noticed the
stealthy progress of the woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“See here, miss,” said the new arrival, “I
have come to help you in the proper way.
Lord love y’ what’s the good o’ calling to that
half mazed man there? By the road you
came, by that you must return. Here be ivy
bands enough for both. Take half yourself
and follow me, or if you’d rather, go on before.
Don’t look at your feet, look ahead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who are you?” asked Arminell in surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Won’t you accept help till you know who
she is that offers it?” asked the woman with
a laugh. “Do you object to lean on a stick
till you know the name of the tree whence it
was cut? I’m not ashamed of what I’m
called, I’m Patience Kite, that lives in the
thatched cottage under the wood at the end
of the quarry. I saw how you came to this
place, and how you have thrown your book
at the captain, because he looked every way
but the right one when he was called. There’s
perversity in all things, miss, as you’ll discover
when you’re a bit older. Them as we
call to come to us don’t look our way, and
them as we ain’t thinking about offer us the
helping hand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell took the proffered ivy ropes, and
began to retrace her steps along the face of
the precipice, but was unable, whilst so doing,
to resist the temptation to look and see if
Captain Saltren had as yet observed her, but
she saw that he was still diving his arms into
the water after the sunken volume, and was
unconscious that any one watched him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hold to my gown, it is coarse, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>better to stay you with,” said the woman. “Do
not look round, keep fast with the right hand
to the ivy, and clutch me with your left.
What a comical bringing together of them
whom God has put asunder that would be if
you and I were to be found in death grappled
together in the quarry pond!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Slowly, cautiously, Arminell followed her
guide and finally reached the firm bank.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now then,” said Patience, “you can
come and rest in my cottage. It is hard by.
I’ll wipe a chair for you. As you wanted to
see the owl’s nest, perhaps you mayn’t object
to visit the house of the white witch.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell hesitated. She was inclined to
return home, but felt that it would seem ungracious
to decline the offer of the woman who
had assisted her out of her difficulties.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look yonder,” mocked Patience, pointing
to the water, “the captain is at his
prayers again. I wonder, now, what he took
that book to be you throwed at him, and
your voice to be that called him? He’ll make
a maze o’ queer fancies out of all, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Does Mr. Saltren often come here?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“When the shoe pinches.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not understand you, Mrs. Kite.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I’ll be bound you do not. How can
you understand the pinching and pain o’
others, when you’ve never felt pinch or pain
yourself? Such as lie a-bed in swans’ down
wonder what keeps them awake that couches
on nettles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what has this to do with Captain
Saltren and his prayers?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Everything,” answered the woman; “you
don’t ask for apples when your lap is full.
Those that suffer and are in need open their
mouths. But whether aught comes to them
for opening their mouths is another matter.
The cuckoo in my clock called, and as none
answered, he gave it up—so did I.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a savagery in the woman’s tone
that startled Arminell, and withal a strangeness
in her manner that attracted her curiosity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will go with you to the cottage for a
moment,” she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is the way,” answered Patience,
leading through the brake of fern under the
oaks.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Patience Kite was a tall woman, with
black hair just turning grey, a wrinkled face,
and a pointed chin. She had lost most of
her teeth, and mouthed her words, but spoke
distinctly. Her nose was like the beak of a
hawk; her eyes were grey, and wild under
heavy dark brows. When she spoke to
Arminell she curtsied, and the curtsey of the
gaunt creature was grotesque. The girl
could not read whether it were intended as
respectful, or done in mockery. Her dress
was tidy, but of the poorest materials, much
patched. She wore no cap; her abundant
hair was heaped on her head, but was less
tidy than her clothing; it was scattered
about her face and shoulders.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her cottage was close at hand, very
small, built of quarry-stone that corroded
rapidly with exposure—the air reduced it to
black dust. The chimney threatened to
fall; it was gnawed into on the south-west
side like a bit of mice-eaten cheese. The
thatch was rotten, the rafters were exposed
and decayed. The walls, bulged out
by the thrust of the bedroom floor-joists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>were full of rents and out of the perpendicular.</p>

<p class='c005'>The place looked so ruinous, so unsafe,
that Arminell hesitated to enter.</p>

<p class='c005'>The door had fallen, because the frame
had rotted away. Patience led her guest
over it into the room. There everything was
tidy and clean. Tidiness and cleanliness
were strangely combined with ruin and decay.
In the window was a raven in a cage.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This house is dangerous to live in,” said
Arminell. “Does Mr. Macduff not see that
repairs are done? It is unfit for human
habitation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Macduff!” scoffed Mrs. Kite. “Do
y’ think that this house belongs to his lordship?
It is mine, and because it is mine
they cannot force me to leave it, and to go
into the workhouse.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you are in peril of your life here,
the chimney might fall and bury you any
windy night. The roof might crash in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So the sanitary officer says. He has
condemned the house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you are leaving?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“No. He has done his duty. But I am
not going to turn out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet surely, Mrs. Kite, if the place is dangerous,
you will not be allowed to remain?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who can interfere with me? The
board of guardians have applied to the petty
sessions for an order, and it has been granted
and served on me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, of course, you go?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No; they can order me to go, but they
cannot force me to go. The policeman says
they can fine me ten shillings a day if I
remain and defy them. Let them fine me.
They must next get an order to distrain to
get the amount. They may sell my furniture,
but they won’t be able to turn me out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But why remain in peril of your life?
You will be crushed under the ruins some
stormy night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why remain here? Because I’ve nowhere
else to go to. I will not go into the
union, and I will not live in a house with
other folk. I am accustomed to be alone.
I am not afraid. Here I am at liberty, and
I will die here rather than lose my freedom.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“You cannot even shut your door.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not need to. I fear nothing, not
the sanitary officer; he can do nothing.
Not the board of guardians; they can do
nothing. Not the magistrates; they cannot
touch me.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c006'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you anything to live on?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I pick up a trifle. I bless bad knees
and stop the flow of blood, and show where
stolen goods are hidden, and tell who has
ill-wished any one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You receive contributions from the
superstitious.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I get my living my own way. There is
room for all in the world.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell seated herself in a chair offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>her, and looked at the raven in its cage,
picking at the bars.</p>

<p class='c005'>Silence ensued for a few minutes. Patience
folded her bare brown arms across her
bosom, and standing opposite the girl,
studied her from head to foot.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Honourable Miss Inglett!” she
said, and laughed. “Why are you the
honourable, and I the common person?
Why are you a lady, at ease, well-dressed,
and I a poor old creature badgered by
sanitary officers and board of guardians, and
magistrates, and by my lord, the chairman
at the petty sessions?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell looked wonderingly at her, surprised
at her strange address.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because the world is governed by injustice.
What had you done as a babe, that
you should have the gold spoon put into
your mouth, and why had I the pewter one?
It is not only sanitary officers and guardians
of the poor against me, bullying me, a poor
lone widow. Heaven above has been dead
set against me from the moment I was
born. I’ve seen the miners truck out ore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>and cable; now a truck load of metal, then
one of refuse; one to be refined, the other
to be rejected. It is so in life; we are run
out of the dark mines of nothingness into
light, and some of us are all preciousness
and some all dross. But do you know this,
Miss Arminell, they turned out heaps on
heaps of refuse from the copper mines, and
now they have abandoned the copper to
work the refuse heaps. They find them
rich—in what do you suppose? In arsenic.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have had much trouble in your
life?” asked Arminell, not knowing what
to say to this strange, bitter woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Much trouble!” Patience curtsied. She
unlaced her arms, and used her hands as
she spoke, like a Frenchwoman. She lacked
the words that would express her thoughts,
and enforced and supplemented them with
gesture. “Much trouble! You shall hear
how I have been served. My father worked
in this old lime quarry till it was abandoned,
and when it stopped, then he was out of
work for two months, and he went out
poaching, and shot himself instead of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>pheasant. He was not used to a gun.
’Twasn’t the fault of the gun. The gun was
good enough. When he was brought home
dead, my mother went into one fainting fit
after another, and I was born; but she died.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The quarry was given up, I suppose,
because it was worked out?” said Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why did Providence allow it to be
worked out so soon? Why wasn’t the lime
made to run ten feet deeper, three feet, one
foot would have done it to keep my father
alive over my birth, and so saved my
mother’s life and made me a happy woman?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And when your poor mother died?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then it was bad for poor me. I was
left an orphan child and was brought up by
my uncle, who was a local preacher. He
wasn’t over-pleased at being saddled wi’ me
to keep. He served me bad, and didn’t
give me enough to eat. Once he gave me a
cruel beating because I wouldn’t say ‘Forgive
us our trespasses,’ for, said I, ‘Heaven
has trespassed against me, not I against
Heaven.’ Why was there not another foot
or eighteen inches more lime created when it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>was made, so that my father and mother
might have lived, and I had a home and not
been given over to uncle? What I said then,
I say now”—all Patience’s fierceness rushed
into her eyes. “Answer me. Have I been
fairly used?” She extended her arms, and
held her hands open, appealing to Arminell
for her judgment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And then?” asked the girl, after a long
silence, during which nothing was heard but
the pecking of the raven at the bars.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And then my uncle bade me unsay my
words, but I would not. Then he swore he
would thrash me every day till I asked forgiveness.
So it came about.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What came about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That I was sent to prison.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not for profanity! for what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For setting fire to his house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You——?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, finish the question. Yes, I did;
and so I was sent to prison.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell involuntarily shrank from the
woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah! I frighten you. But the blame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>does not attach to me. Why were there not
a few inches more lime created when the
quarry was ordained? Providence means, I
am told, fore-seeing. When the world was
made I reckon it was foreseen that for lack
of a little more lime my father would shoot
himself, and the shock kill my mother, and
cast me without parents on the hands of a
hard uncle, who treated me so bad that I was
forced to set his thatch in a blaze, and so
was sent to prison. Providence saw all that
in the far-off, and held hands and did not lay
another handful of lime.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you ever been married?” asked
Arminell, startled by the defiance, the rage
and revolt in the woman’s heart. She asked
the question without consideration, in the
hope of diverting the thoughts of Mrs. Kite
into another channel.</p>

<p class='c005'>Patience was silent for a moment, and
looked loweringly at the young lady, then
answered abruptly, “No—a few inches of
lime short stopped that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How did that prevent your marriage?
The quarry was stopped before you were born.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“Right, and because stopped, my father
was shot and I became an orphan, and was
took by my uncle, and fired his house, and
was sent to gaol. After that no man cared
to take to wife a woman who put lighted
sticks among the thatch. No respectable
man would share his name with one who had
been in prison. But I was a handsome girl
in my day—and—but there—I will tell you
no more. The stopping of the quarry did it.
If there had been laid at the bottom a few
inches more of lime rock, it would never
have happened. Where lies the blame?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Another quarry was opened,” said Arminell,
“that where Mr. Tubb is captain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“True,” answered Patience; “but between
the closing of one and the opening of
another, my father bought a gun, and went
over a hedge with it on a moonlight night,
and the trigger caught.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell rose.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been here for some time,” she
said, “and I ought to be on my way home.
You will permit me—” she felt in her pocket
for her purse.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“No,” said Patience curtly. “You have
paid me for what I did by listening to my
story. But stay—Have you heard that if
you go to a pixy mound, and take the soil
thereof and put it on your head, you can see
the little people, and hear their voices, and
know all they say and do. You have come
here—to this heap of ruin and wretchedness,”
she stooped and gathered up some of the
dust off the floor and ashes from the hearth,
and threw them on the head of Arminell. “I
am a witch, they say. It is well; now your
eyes and ears are opened to see and know
and feel with those you never knew of before
this day—another kind of creatures to yourself—the
poor, the wretched, the lonely.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Arminell Inglett walked musingly from the
cottage of Patience Kite. The vehemence
of the woman, the sad picture she had unfolded
of a blighted life, the look she had
been given into a heart in revolt against the
Divine government of the world, united to impress
and disturb Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>Questions presented themselves to her
which she had never considered before.
Why were the ways of Heaven unequal?
Why, if God created all men of one flesh, and
breathed into all a common spirit, why were
they differently equipped for life’s journey?
Why were some sent to encounter the freezing
blast in utter nakedness, and others
muffled in eider-down? The Norns who
spin the threads of men’s lives, spin some
of silk and others of tow. The Parcæ who
shovel the lots of men out of bushels of gold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>dust and soot, give to some soot only; they
do not trouble themselves to mix the ingredients
before allotting them.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Arminell walked on, revolving in her
mind the perplexing question which has ever
remained unsolved and continues to puzzle
and drive to despair those in all ages who
consider it, she came before the house of
Captain Saltren.</p>

<p class='c005'>The house lay in a narrow glen, so narrow
that it was lighted and warmed by very little
sun. A slaty rock rose above it, and almost
projected over it. This rock, called the
Cleve, was crowned with heather, and ivy
scrambled up it from below. A brook
brawled down the glen below the house.</p>

<p class='c005'>The coombe had been wild and disregarded,
a jungle of furze and bramble, till
Saltren’s father settled in it, and no man
objecting, enclosed part of the waste, built a
house, and called it his own. Lord Lamerton
owned the manor, and might have interfered,
or claimed ground-rent, but in a former generation
much careless good-nature existed among
landlords, and squatters were suffered to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>seize on and appropriate land that was regarded
of trifling value. The former Lord
Lamerton perhaps knew nothing of the appropriation.
His agent was an old, gouty,
easy-going man who looked into no matters
closely, and so the Saltrens became possessed
of Chillacot without having any title to show
for it. By the same process Patience Kite’s
father had obtained his cottage, and Patience
held her house on the same tenure
as Saltren held Chillacot. Usually when
settlers enclosed land and built houses, they
were charged a trifling ground-rent, and they
held their houses and fields for a term of
years or for lives, and the holders were
bound to keep the dwellings in good repair.
But, practically, such houses are not kept up,
and when the leases expire, or the lives fall
in the houses fall in also. A landlord with such
dwellings and tenements on his property is
often glad to buy out the holders to terminate
the disgrace to the place of having in it so many
dilapidated and squalid habitations.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren’s house was not in a dilapidated
condition; on the contrary, it was neat and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>in excellent repair. Stephen drew a respectable
salary as captain of the manganese mine
and could afford to spend money on the little
property of which he was proud. He had
had the house recently re-roofed with slate
instead of thatch, with which it had been
formerly covered. The windows and doors
had been originally made of home-grown deal,
not thoroughly mature, and it had rotted.
Saltren renewed the wood-work throughout.
Moreover, the chimney having been erected
of the same stone as that of Kite’s cottage,
had decayed in the same manner. Saltren
had it taken down and rebuilt in brick, which
came expensive, as brick had to be carted
from fourteen miles off. But, as the captain
said, one does not mind spending money on a
job designed to be permanent. Saltren had
restocked his garden with fruit trees three or
four years ago, and these now gave promise
of bearing.</p>

<p class='c005'>The glen in which Chillacot lay was a
“coombe,” that is, it was a short lateral
valley running up into hill or moor, and opening
into the main valley through which flows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the arterial stream of the district. It was a
sequestered spot, and as the glen was narrow,
it did not get its proper share of sun. Some
said the glen was called Chillacoombe because
it was chilly, but the rector derived the name
from the Celtic word for wood.</p>

<p class='c005'>We hear much now-a-days about hereditary
instincts and proclivities, and a man’s character
is thought to be determined by those of
his ancestors. But locality has much to do
with the determination of character. Physical
causes model, develop, or alter physical
features; national characteristics are so shaped,
and why not individual characters also?</p>

<p class='c005'>The climate of England is responsible to a
large extent for the formation of the representative
John Bull. The blustering winds,
the uncertain weather, go to the hardening of
the Englishman’s self-reliance, determination,
and perseverance under difficulties. He cannot
wait to make hay till the sun shines, he
must make it whether the sun shines or not.
Having to battle with wind and rain, and face
the searching east wind, to confront sleet,
and snow, and hail from childhood, when, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>shining face and satchel he goes to school,
the boy learns to put down his head and defy
the weather. Having learned to put down
his head and go along as a boy, he does the
same all through life, not against weather
only, but against everything that opposes,
with teeth clenched, and fists rolled up in his
breeches pocket.</p>

<p class='c005'>The national characteristic affects the very
animals bred in our storm-battered isle. A
friend of the author had a puppy brought out
to him on the continent from England. That
little creature sought out, fought, and rolled
over every dog in the city where it was.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat ish not a doug of dish countree!”
said a native who observed its pugnacity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no, it is an English pup.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ach so! I daught as much, it ist one
deevil!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps the gloom of Chillacot, its sunlessness,
was one cause of the gravity that
affected Saltren’s mind, and made him silent,
fanatical, shadow-haunted. The germs of the
temperament were in him from boyhood, but
were not fully developed till after his marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>and the disappointment and disillusioning
that ensued. He was a man devoid of
humour, a joke hurt and offended him, if it
was not sinful, it closely fringed on sin, because
he could not appreciate it. He had a
tender, affectionate heart, full of soft places,
and, but for his disappointment, would have
been a kindly man; but he had none to love.
The wife had betrayed him, the child was not
his own. The natural instincts of his heart
became perverted, he waxed bitter, suspicious,
and ready to take umbrage at trifles.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Arminell came in front of the cottage,
she saw Mrs. Saltren leaning over the gate.
She was a woman who still bore the traces of
her former beauty, her nose and lips were delicately
moulded, and her eyes were still lovely,
large and soft, somewhat sensuous in their
softness. The face was not that of a woman
of decided character, the mouth was weak.
Her complexion was clear. Jingles had inherited
his good looks from her. As Arminell
approached, she curtsied, then opened
the gate, and asked—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Inglett, if I may be so bold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>would so much like to have a word with
you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly,” answered Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you honour me, miss, by taking a
seat on the bench?” asked Mrs. Saltren,
pointing to a garden bench near the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell declined graciously. She could
not stay long, she had been detained already,
and had transgressed the luncheon hour.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, Miss Inglett,” said the captain’s wife,
“I did so admire and love your dear mother,
the late lady, she was so good and kind, and
she took—though I say it—a sort of fancy to
me, and was uncommonly gracious to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You were at the park once?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was there before I married, but that was
just a few months before my lord married
your mother, the first Lady Lamerton. I
never was in the house with her, but she
often came and saw me. That was a bad
day for many of us—not only for you, miss,
but for all of us—when she died. If she had
lived, I don’t think we could have fallen into
this trouble.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What trouble?” Arminell asked. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>was touched by the reference to her mother,
about whom she knew and was told so little.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean, miss, the mine that is being
stopped. Her dear late ladyship would never
have allowed it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But it runs under the house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, miss, nothing of the sort. That is
what Mr. Macduff says, because he is trying
to persuade his lordship to close the mine.
It is not for me to speak against him, but he
is much under the management of Mrs. Macduff,
who is a very fine lady; and because
the miners don’t salute her, she gives Macduff
no rest, day or night, till he gets his lordship
to disperse the men. My lord listens to him,
and does not see who is speaking through his
lips. My brother James is a comical-minded
man, and he said one day that Mr.
Macduff was like the automaton chess-player
that was once exhibited in London.
Every one thought the wax doll played, but
there was a young girl hid in a compartment
under the table, and she directed all the
movements of the chess-player.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I really cannot interfere between my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>lord and his agent, or intercept communications
between Mr. Chess-player and Mrs.
Prompter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no, miss; I never meant anything
of the sort. I was only thinking how
different it would have been for us if my
lady—I mean my late lady—were here.
She was a good friend to us. Oh, miss, I
shall never forget when I was ill of the
typhus, and everyone was afraid to come
near us, how my good lady came here,
carrying a sheet to the window, and tapped,
and gave it in, because she thought we
might be short of linen for my bed. I’ve
never forgot that. I keep that sheet to this
day, and I shall not part with it; it shall
serve as my winding sheet. The dear good
lady was so thoughtful for the poor. But
times are changed. It is not for me to cast
blame, or to say that my lady as now is, is
not good, but there are different kinds of
goodnesses as there are cabbage roses and
Marshal Neils.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was interested and touched.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You knew my dear mother well?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“I am but a humble person, and it is unbecoming
of me to say it, though I have a
brother who is a gentleman, who associates
with the best in the land, and I am better
born than you may suppose, seeing that I
married a captain of a manganese mine. I
beg pardon—I was saying that her ladyship
almost made a friend of me, though I say it
who ought not. Still, I had feelings and
education above my station, and that perhaps
led her to consult me when she came
here to Orleigh and knew nothing of the
place or of the people, and might have been
imposed on, but for me. After I recovered
of the scarlet fever——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought it was typhus?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It began scarlet and ended typhus.
Those fevers, miss, as my brother James
says in his droll way, are like tradesmen,
they make jobs for each other, and hand on
the patient.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How long was that after Mr. Jingles—I
mean your son, Mr. Giles Saltren, was
born?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,”—Mrs. Saltren looked about her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>rather vaguely—“not over long. Will you
condescend to step indoors and see my little
parlour, where I think, miss, you have never
been yet, though it is scores and scores of
times your dear mother came there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will come in,” said Arminell readily.
Her heart warmed to the woman who had
been so valued by her mother.</p>

<p class='c005'>The house was tidy, dismal indeed, and
small, but what made it most dismal was the
strain after grandeur, the gay table-cover,
the carpet with large pattern, the wall paper
black with huge bunches of red and white
roses on it, out of keeping with the dimensions
of the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell looked round and felt a rising
sense of the absurdity, the affectation, the
incongruity, that at any other moment would
have made her laugh inwardly, though too
well-bred to give external sign that she
ridiculed what she saw.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah miss!” said Mrs. Saltren, “you’re
looking at that beautiful book on the table.
My lady gave it me herself, and I value it,
not because of what it contains, nor for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>handsome binding, but because of her who
gave it to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell took up the book and opened it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But—” she said,—“the date. It is an
annual, published three years after my
mother’s death.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I beg your pardon, miss, I did not
say my late lady gave it me. I said, my
lady. I know how to distinguish between
them. If it had been given me by your
dear mother, who is gone, my late lady, do
you suppose it would be lying here? I
would not keep it in the room where I sit
but rarely, but have it in my bed-chamber,
where I could fold my hands over it when I
pray.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should like,” said Arminell, “to see
the sheet that my poor dear mother gave
you, and which you cherish so fondly, to
wrap about you in the grave.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“With pleasure,” said Mrs. Saltren. “No—I
won’t say with pleasure, for it calls up
sad recollections, and yet, miss, there is
pleasure in thinking of the goodness of that
dear lady who is gone. Lor! miss, it did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>seem dreadful that my dear lady when on
earth didn’t take precedency over the
daughter of an earl, but now, in heaven, she
ranks above marchionesses.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then she asked Arminell to take a chair,
and went slowly upstairs to search for the
sheet. While she was absent the girl looked
round her, and now her lips curled with
derision at the grotesque strain after refinement
and luxury which were unattainable as
a whole, and only reached in inharmonious
scraps and disconnected patches.</p>

<p class='c005'>This was the home of Jingles! What a
change for him, from these mean surroundings,
this tasteless affectation, to the stateliness
and smoothness of life at Orleigh Park!
How keenly he must feel the contrast when
he returned home! Had her father dealt
rightly by the young man, in giving him
culture beyond his position? It is said that
a man has sat in an oven whilst a chop has
been done, and has eaten the chop, without
being himself roasted, but then the temperature
of the oven was gradually raised and
gradually lowered. Young Saltren had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>jumped into the oven out of a cellar and
passed every now and then back again to the
latter. This alteration of temperatures would
kill him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some time elapsed before Mrs. Saltren returned.
She descended the stair slowly,
sighing, with the sheet over her arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You need not fear to catch the fever from
it, miss,” she said, “it has been washed many
times since it was used—with my tears.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell’s heart was full. She took the
sheet and looked at it. How good, how considerate
her mother had been. And what a
touch of real feeling this was in the faithful
creature, to cherish the token of her mother’s
kindness.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young are sentimental, and are incapable
of distinguishing true feeling from false
rhodomontade.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why!” exclaimed Arminell, “it has a
mark in the corner S.S,—does not that stand
for your husband’s initials?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The woman seemed a little taken aback,
but soon recovered herself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It may be so. But it comes about like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>this. I asked Stephen to mark the sheet for
me with a double L. for Louisa, Lady Lamerton,
and a coronet over, but he was so
scrupulous, he said it might be supposed I had
carried it away from the park, and that as the
sheet was given to us, we’d have it marked as
our own. My husband is as particular about
his conscience as one must be with the bones
in a herring. It was Bond’s marking ink he
used,” said Mrs. Saltren, eager to give minute
circumstances that might serve as confirmation
of her story, “and there was a stretcher
of wood, a sort of hoop, that strained the linen
whilst it was being written on. If you have
any doubt, miss, about my story, you’ve only
to ask for a bottle of Bond’s marking ink
and you will see that they have circular
stretchers—which is a proof that this is the
identical sheet my lady gave me. Besides,
there is a number under the letters.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, seven.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That was my device. It rhymes with
heaven, where my lady,—I mean my late lady
is now taking precedence even of marchionesses.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Arminell said nothing. The woman’s mind
was like her parlour, full of incongruities.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look about you, miss,” continued Mrs.
Saltren, “though I say it, who ought not,
this is a pretty and comfortable house with a
certain elegance which I have introduced into
it. My brother, James Welsh, is a gentleman,
and writes a great deal. You may
understand how troubled my husband is at
the thought of leaving it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But—why leave?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because, Miss Inglett, he will have no
work here. He will be driven to go to
America, and unfortunately he has expended
his savings in doing up the house and planting
the garden. I am too delicate to risk the
voyage, so I shall be separated from my
husband. My son Giles has already been
taken from me.” Then she began to cry.</p>

<p class='c005'>A pair of clove-pinks glowed in Arminell’s
cheeks. She could hardly control her voice.
These poor Saltrens were badly used; her
father was to blame. He was the occasion
of their trouble.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It must not be,” said Arminell, starting up,
“I will go at once and speak to his lordship.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER VII.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>A VISION.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Without another word Arminell left the
cottage. As she did so, she passed Captain
Saltren speaking to Captain Tubb. The
former scarce touched his hat, but the latter
saluted her with profound respect.</p>

<p class='c005'>When she was out of hearing, Saltren,
whose dark eyes had pursued her, said in a
low vibrating tone—</p>

<p class='c005'>“There she goes—one of the Gilded
Clique.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think you might have shown her more
respect, man,” said Tubb. “Honour to
whom honour is due, and she is honourable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why should I show respect to her? If
she were a poor girl earning her bread, I
would salute her with true reverence, for God
hath chosen the poor, rich in faith. But is it
not written that it is easier for a camel to pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>through the eye of a needle, than for the rich
to enter into heaven?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ve queer fancies, Cap’n.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They are not fancies,” answered Saltren;
“as it is written, so I speak.” Then he
hesitated. Something was working in his
mind, and for a moment he doubted whether
to speak it to one whom he did not regard as
of the elect.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Saltren was not a man who could restrain
himself under an over-mastering conviction,
and he burst forth in a torrent of words,
and as he spoke his sombre eyes gleamed
with excitement, and sparks lit up and flashed
in them. Soft they usually were, and dreamy,
but now, all at once they kindled into
vehement life.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I tell you, Tubb, the Lord hath spoken.
The last days are at hand. I read my Bible
and I read my newspaper, and I know that
the aristocracy are a scandal and a burden to
the country. Now the long-suffering of
heaven will not tarry. It has been revealed
to me that they are doomed to destruction.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Revealed to <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“Yes, to me, an unworthy creature, as
none know better than myself, full of errors
and faults and blindness—and yet—to me.
I was wrestling in spirit near the water’s
edge, thinking of these things, when, suddenly,
I heard a voice from heaven calling
me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How—by name? Did it call you
Cap’n?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren hesitated. “I can’t mind just now
whether it said, Saltren, Saltren! or whether
it said Mister, or whether Cap’n, or Stephen.
I dare say I shall remember by-and-by when
I come to turn it over in my mind. But all
has come on me so freshly, so suddenly, that
I am still dazed with the revelations.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go on,” said Tubb, shaking his head
dubiously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And when I looked up, I saw a book
come flying down to me out of heaven, and I
held up my hands to receive it, but it went
by me into the water hard by where I was.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Somebody chucked it at you,” exclaimed
the practical Tubb.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I tell you, it came down out of heaven,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>said Saltren, impatiently. “You have no
faith. I saw the book, and before I could
lay hold of it, it went under the raft—I mean,
it went down, down in the water, and I beheld
it no more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What sort of a book was it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I saw it but for a moment, as it floated
with the back upwards, before it disappeared.
There was a head on it and a title. I could
not make out whose head, but I read the
title, and the title was clear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘The Gilded Clique.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Clique! what was that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A society, a party, and I know what was
meant.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some one must have chucked the book,”
again reasoned the prosaic Tubb.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was not chucked, it fell. I was wrong
to tell you of my vision. The revelation is
not for such as you. I will say no more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And pray, what do you make out of this
queer tale?” asked the captain of the lime
quarry with ill-disguised incredulity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it not plain as the day? I have had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>revealed to me that the doom of the British
aristocracy is pronounced, the House of
Lords, the privileged class,—in a word, the
whole Gilded Clique?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Tubb shook his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ll never satisfy me it weren’t
chucked,” he said. “But, to change the
subject, Saltren. You have read and studied
more than I have. Can you tell me what
sort of a plant Quinquagesima is, and
whether it is grown from seed, or cuttings, or
layers?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c004'>As Arminell left Chillacot she did not observe
the scant courtesy shown her by Captain
Saltren. She was brimming with sympathy
for him in his trouble, with tender feeling for
the wife who had so loved her mother, and
for the son who was out of his proper element.
It did not occur to her that possibly she
might be regarded by Saltren with disfavour.
She had not gone many paces from the house
before she came on a middle-aged couple,
walking in the sun, abreast, arm in arm, the
man smoking a pipe, which he removed and
concealed in the pocket of his old velvet
shooting coat, when he saw Arminell, and
then he respectfully removed his hat. The
two had been at church. Arminell knew
them by sight, but she had not spoken at any
time to either. The man, she had heard,
had once been a gamekeeper on the property,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>but had been dismissed, the reason forgotten,
probably dishonesty. The woman was handsome,
with bright complexion, and very clear,
crystalline eyes, a boldly cut nose, and well
curved lips. The cast of her features was
strong, yet the expression of the face was
timid, patient and pleading.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had fair, very fair hair, hair that would
imperceptibly become white, so that on a
certain day, those who knew her would exclaim,
“Why Joan! who would have thought
it? Your hair is white.” But some years
must pass before the bleaching of Joan’s head
was accomplished. She was only forty, and
was hale and strongly built.</p>

<p class='c005'>She unlinked her arm from that of her
companion and came curtseying to Arminell,
who saw that she wore a hideous crude
green kerchief, and in her bonnet, magenta
bows.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you want me?” she asked coldly.
The unæsthetic colours offended her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please, my lady!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not ‘my lady.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>Joan was abashed, and retreated a step.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“I am Miss Inglett. What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was going to make so bold, my la— I
mean, miss——.” Joan became crimson with
shame at so nearly transgressing again.
“This is Samuel Ceely.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell nodded. She was impatient, and
wanted to be at home. She looked at the
man whose pale eyes quivered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is he your husband?” asked Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, miss, not exactly. Us have been
keeping company twenty years—no more.
How many years is it since us first took up
wi’ each other, Samuel?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nigh on twenty-two. Twenty-two.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go along, Samuel, not so much as that.
Well, miss, us knowed each other when
Samuel was a desperate wicked (<i>i.e.</i> lively)
chap. Then Samuel was keeper at the
park. There was some misunderstanding.
The head-keeper was to blame and laid it on
Samuel. He’s told me so scores o’ times.
Then came his first accident. When was
that, Samuel?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“When I shooted my hand away? Nineteen
years come next Michaelmas.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“Were you keeper, then?” asked
Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, miss, not exactly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, how came you with the gun?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By accident, quite by accident.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Joan hastily interfered. It would not do
to enquire too closely what he was doing on
that occasion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“When was your second accident, Samuel?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fifteen years agone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what was that?” asked Joan.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I falled off a waggon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell interrupted. This was the scene
of old Gobbo and young Gobbo reenacted.
It must be brought to an end. “Tell thou
the tale,” she said with an accent of impatience
in her intonation, addressing Joan.
“What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Joan Melhuish, miss. Us have been
sweethearts a great many years; and, miss,
the poor old man can’t do a sight of work,
because of his leg, and because of his hand.
But, lor-a-mussy, miss, his sweepings is
beautiful. You could eat your dinner, miss,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>off a stable floor, where Samuel has swept.
Or the dog-kennels, miss,—if Samuel were
but with the dogs, he’d be as if in Paradise.
He do love dogs dearly, do Samuel. He’s
that conscientious, miss, that if he was sound
asleep, and minded in his dream there was
a bit o’ straw lying where he ought to ha’
swept clean, or that the dogs as needed it,
hadn’t had brimstone put in their water, he’d
get up out o’ the warmest bed—not, poor
chap, that he’s got a good one to lie on—to
give the dog his brimstone, or pick up
thickey (that) straw.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She was so earnest, so sincere, that her
story appealed to Arminell’s feelings. Was
the dust that the witch, Patience, had cast on
her head, taking effect and opening her eyes
to the sorrows and trials of the underground
folk?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please, miss! It ain’t only sweeping he
does beautifully. If a dog has fleas, he’ll
wash him and comb him—and, miss, he can
skin a hare or a rabbit beautiful—beautiful!
I don’t mean to deny that Samuel takes time
about it,” she assumed an apologetic tone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“but then, miss, which be best, to be slow
and do a thing thorough, or be quick and
half do it? Now, miss, what I was going
to make so bold as to say was, Samuel do be
a-complaining of the rheumatics. They’ve
a-took’n bad across the loins, and it be bad
for him out in all weathers weeding turnips,
and doing them odd and dirty jobs, men
won’t do now, nor wimen n’other, what wi’
the advance of education, and the franchise,
and I did think it would be wonderful good
and kind o’ you, miss, if you’d put in a word
for Samuel, just to have the sweeping o’ the
back yard, or the pulling of rabbits, or the
cleaning up of dishes, he’d make a rare
kitchen-maid, and could scour the dogs as
well, and keep ’em from scratching over
much. Lord, miss! what the old man do
want is nourishing food and dryth (dry air)
over and about him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll speak to the housekeeper—no, I will
speak to her ladyship about the matter. I have
no doubt something can be done for Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Joan curtsied, and her honest face shone
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“Lord A’mighty bless you, miss! I have
been that concerned about the old man—he
is but fifty, but looks older, because of his
two accidents. H’s shy o’ asking for hisself,
because he was dismissed by the late lord;
the upper keeper laid things on him he’d no
right to. He’s a man, miss, who don’t set no
store on his self, because he has lost a thumb
and two fingers, and got a dislocated thigh.
But there’s more in Samuel than folks fancy,
I ought to know best, us have kept company
twenty years.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you ever going to get married?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Joan shook her head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But how is it,” asked Arminell, “that
you have not been married yet, after courting
so long?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“First the bursted gun spoiled the chance—but
Lord, miss, though he’s lost half his
hand, he is as clever with what remains as
most men with two.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He was unable to work for his living, I
suppose?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And next he were throwed down off a
waggon, and he’s been lame ever since. But,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Lord, miss! he do get along with the bad
leg, beautiful, quite beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are not nearer your marriage than
you were twenty years ago,” said Arminell,
pitifully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been that troubled for Samuel,”
said Joan, not replying, but continuing her
own train of thought; “I’ve feared he’d be
took off to the union, and then the old man
would ha’ died, not having me to walk out
with of a Sunday and bring him a little ’baccy.
And I—I’d ha’ nort in the world to live for,
or to hoard my wages for, wi’out my old
Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The woman paused, turned round and
looked at the feeble, disabled wreck of a man,
who put his crippled hand to his forelock and
saluted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How came he to fall off the waggon?”
asked Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, miss, it came of my being on the
waggon,” explained Ceely, “I couldn’t have
falled off otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Were you asleep? Was the waggon in
motion?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Joan hastily interfered, it would not do for
too close an enquiry to be made into how it
came that Samuel was incapable of keeping
himself firm on the waggon; any more than
it would do to go too narrowly into the occasion
of his shooting off his hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was it, miss, you was a-saying?
Nearer our marriage? That is as the Lord
wills. But—miss—us two have set our
heads on one thing. I don’t mind telling
you, as you’re so kind as to promise you’d
get Samuel a situation as kitchen-maid.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I did not promise that!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, miss, you said you’d speak about
it, and I know well enough that what you
speak about will be done.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it you have set your heart on?
Can I help you to that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You, miss! O no, only the Lord. You
see, miss, I don’t earn much, and Samuel
next to nothing at all, so our ever having a
home of our own do seem a long way off.
But there’s the north side of the church,
where Samuel’s two fingers and thumb be
laid, us can go to them. And us have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>bespoke to the sexton the place whereabout
the fingers and thumb lie. I ha’
planted rosemary there, and know where
it be, and no one else can be laid
there, as his fingers and thumb be resting
there. And when Samuel dies, or I
die, whichever goes first is to lie beside the
rosemary bush over his fingers and thumb,
and when the t’other follows, Samuel or I
will be laid beside the other, with only the
fingers and thumb and rosemary bush between
us,—’cos us ain’t exactly married—and
’twouldn’t be respectable wi’out. ’Twill be
no great expense,” she added apologetically.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Joan Melhuish had told all her
story, Arminell no longer saw the crude
green kerchief and the magenta bows. She
saw only the face of the poor woman, the
crystal-clear eyes in which light came, and
then moisture, and the trembling lips that
told more by their tremor than by the words
that passed over them, of the deep stirring
in the humble, patient heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>How often it is with us that, looking at
others, who belong to an inferior, or only a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>distinct class, we observe nothing but verdigris
green kerchiefs and magenta bows, something
out of taste, jarring with our refinement,
ridiculous from our point of view. Then we
talk of the whole class as supremely barbarous,
grotesque and separate from us by
leagues of intervening culture, a class that
puts verdigris kerchiefs on and magenta
bows, as our forefathers before Christ painted
their bodies with woad. And we argue—these
people have no human instincts, no
tender emotions, no delicate feelings—how
can they have, wearing as they do green ties
and magenta bows? Have the creatures
eyes? Surely not when they wear such unæsthetic
colours. Hands, organs, dimensions,
senses, affections, passions? Not with
emerald-green kerchiefs. If we prick them
they do not bleed. If we tickle they cannot
laugh. If we poison them, they will not die.
If we wrong them—bah! They wear
magenta bows and are ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c005'>It needs, may be, a sod taken from their
soil, a little dust from their hearth shaken
over our heads to open our eyes to see that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>they have like passions and weaknesses with
ourselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell, without speaking, turned to
Samuel, and looked at him.</p>

<p class='c005'>What was there in this poor creature to
deserve such faithful love? He was a ruin,
and not the ruin of a noble edifice, but of a
commonplace man. There was no beauty in
him, no indication of talent in his face, no
power in the moulding of his brow. He
looked absurd in his short, shabby, patched,
velveteen coat, his breeches and gaiters on
distorted limbs. His attitudes with the ill-set
thigh were ungainly. And yet—this
handsome woman had given up her life to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He don’t seem much to you, perhaps,
miss,” said Joan, who eagerly scanned
Arminell’s face, and with the instinctive
jealousy of love discovered her thoughts.
“But, miss, what saith the Scripture? Look
not on his countenance, or on the height of
his stature. You should ha’ seen Samuel
before his accidents. Then he was of a
ruddy countenance, and goodly to look on.
I always see him as he was.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>She still searched Arminell’s face for token
of admiration.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lord, miss! tastes differ. Some like
apples and others like onions. For my part,
I do like a hand wi’ two fingers on it, it is
uncommon, it is properly out o’ the way as
hands are. And then, miss, Samuel do seem
to me to ha’ laid hold of eternity wi’ two
fingers and a thumb, having sent them on
before him, and that is more than can be
said of most of us poor sinners here
below.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She still studied the girl’s countenance,
and Arminell controlled its expression.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then,” Joan continued, “as for his walk,
it is lovely. It is ever dancing as he goes
along the road. It makes one feel young—a
girl—to have his arm, there be such a
lightness and swing in his walk.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But—” Arminell began, then hesitated,
and then went on with a rush, “are you not
discontented, impatient, miserable?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why so, miss?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because you have loved him so long and
see no chance of getting him.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“No, miss. If I get him here, I get him
to give me only half a hand; if I get him in
the other world, I get his whole hand, thumb
and two first fingers as well. I be content
either way.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>On the edge of a moor, at the extreme
limits to which man had driven back savage
nature, where were the last boundary walls
of stone piled up without compacting mortar,
was a farm-house called Court. It stood at
the point where granite broke out from
under the schistose beds, and where it had
tilted these beds up into a perpendicular
position. A vast period of time had passed
since the molten granite thus broke forth, and
the ragged edges of upturned rock had been
weathered down to mere stumps, but on
these stumps sat the homestead and farm-house
of Court, with a growth of noble
sycamores about it.</p>

<p class='c005'>A stream brawling down from the moor
swept half round this mass of old worn-down
rock, a couple of granite slabs had been cast
across it, meeting in the middle on a rude
pier, and this served as a foot-bridge, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>carts and waggons traversed the water, and
scrambled up a steep ascent cut out of the
rock by wheels and winter runs.</p>

<p class='c005'>If Court had been a corn-growing farm,
this would have been inconvenient, but this,
Court was not. It was a sheep and cattle
rearing farm, and on it was tilled nothing
but a little rye and some turnips.</p>

<p class='c005'>In an elastic air fresh from the ocean, at a
height of a thousand feet above the sea, the
lungs find delight in each inhalation, and the
pulses leap with perennial youth. Pecuniary
embarrassments cease to oppress, and the
political outlook appears less threatening.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the bottom of yonder valley three
hundred feet above the sea-level, where a
steamy, dreamy atmosphere hangs, we see
that England is going to the dogs, the end of
English commerce, agriculture, the aristocracy,
the church, the crown, the constitution
is at hand—in a word, the <i>Saturday
Review</i> expresses exactly our temper of
mind. A little way up the hill, we think the
recuperative power of the British nation is so
great, the national vigour is so enormous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>that it will shake itself free of its troubles in
time—in time, and with patience—in a word,
we begin to see through the spectacles of the
<i>Spectator</i>. But when we have our foot on
the heather, and scent the incense of the
gorse, and hear the stonechat and the pewit,
and see the flicker of the silver cotton grass
about us, why then—we feel we are in the
best of worlds, and in the best little nook of
the whole world, and that all mankind is
pushing its way, like us, upward with a
scramble over obstacles; it will, like us, in the
end breathe the same sparkling air, and enjoy
the same extensive outlook, and be like us
without care.</p>

<p class='c005'>From Court what a wonderful prospect
was commanded. The Angel in the Apocalypse
stood with one foot on the land, and
the other in the sea; so Court stood half in
the rich cultivated garden of the Western
Paradise, and half in the utter desolation of
treeless moor. To south and west lay
woodlands and pasture, parks and villages,
tufts of Scotch fir, cedars, oak and elm and
beech, with rooks cawing and doves cooing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>and the woodpecker hooting among them;
to the east and north lay the haunt of the
blackcock and hawk and wimbrel, and tracts
of heather flushed with flower, and gorse
ablaze with sun, and aromatic as incense.</p>

<p class='c005'>Far away in the north-west, when the sun
went down, he set in a quiver of golf-leaf, he
doubled his size, and expired like the phœnix
in flame. That was when he touched the
ocean, and in touching revealed it.</p>

<p class='c005'>What a mystery there is in distance!
How the soul is drawn forth step by step
over each rolling hill, down each half-disclosed
valley. How it wonders at every
sparkle where a far-off window reflects the
sun, and admires where the mists gather in
wooded clefts, and asks, what is that?
when the sun discloses white specks far
away on slopes of turquoise; as the Israelites
asked when they saw the Manna. How a
curling pillar of smoke stirs up interest,
rising high and dispersing slowly. We
watch and are filled with conjecture.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the afternoon sun shines sideways on
the moor-cheek, it discloses what it did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>reveal at other times, the faintest trace of
furrows where are no fields now, where no
plough has run since the memory of man.
Was corn once grown there? At that bleak
altitude? Did the climate permit of its
ripening at one time? No one can answer
these questions, but how else account for
these furrows occasionally, only under certain
aspects discernible? And to Court there
was a corn-chamber, a sort of tower standing
on a solid basement of stone six feet above
the ground, a square construction all of
granite blocks, floored within with granite,
and with a conical slated roof, and a flight of
stone steps leading up to it. A tower—a
fortress built against rats, who will gnaw
through oak and even lead, but must break
their teeth against granite.</p>

<p class='c005'>The corn-chamber was overhung by a
sycamore, and at its side a rown, or “witch-bean”
as it is locally called—a mountain ash—had
taken root, flourished and ripened its
crimson berries.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the lowest step but one of the flight
leading to the corn-chamber sat Thomasine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Kite, the daughter of the white-witch, Patience.
The evening was still and balmy in the
valleys; here on the moor-edge airs ever
stirred and were crisp. The bells were ringing
for evening service far away in a belfry
that stood on a hill against the western sky,
and their music came in wafts mingled with
the hum of the wind among the heather, and
the twitter among the sycamores.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aloft, on the highest twig of the tallest
tree sat a crow calling itself in Greek, Korax!
and so pleased with the sound of its name in
Greek that it repeated its name again and
again, and grew giddy with vanity, and
nearly overbalanced itself, and had to spread
wings and recover its poise.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thomasine was in a bad humour. All the
household of Court were away, master and
mistress, men and maids, and she was left
alone like that crow on the tree-tops.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tamsin!” muttered the girl, “what a
foolish name I have got. It’s like damson, of
which they make cheese. If they’d call me by
my proper name of Thomasine, it would be
all right, but Tamsin I hate.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Korax!” croaked the crow. “Why was
I not born in Greece to be called Korax?
Crow is vulgar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m tired of my place,” grumbled the girl,
“here I am a servant maid at Court, out of
the world and hard worked. Nothing going
on, nothing to see, no amusements, nothing
to read.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Why was Thomasine restless and impatient
for a change? She did not herself
know. She was dissatisfied with what? She
did not herself properly know. She had
vigorous health; she had work, but not more
than what with her fresh youth and hearty
body she could easily execute. She had
sufficient to eat. The farmer and his wife
were not exacting, nor rough and bad tempered.
The workmen and women on the farm were,
as workmen and women are, with good and
bad points about them. Elsewhere she
would meet with much the same sort of
associates. She knew that. Her wage was
not high, but it was as much as she was
likely to get in a farm-house, and a small
wage there with freedom was better than a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>big wage in a gentleman’s family with restraint.
She knew that. Yet she was not
content. She wanted something, and she
did not know what. She would give her
mistress notice and go elsewhere. Whither?
She did not know. At any rate it would be
elsewhere, a change; and she craved for a
change, for she had been a twelvemonth in
one place. Would she like her new situation?
She did not know. Would she, when in a
town, look back on the healthy life at Court?
Possibly; she did not know. But she could
not stay, because as the passion for roving is
in the gipsy blood, so was the fever of unrest
in hers. She was tired of life as it presented
itself to her, uniform, commonplace, unsensational.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a period in European history
when all was change, when every people
plucked itself out of its ancestral ground and
went a wandering; when the whole of the
continent was trampled over by races galloping
west, like cattle and wild beasts disturbed
by a prairie fire. What was the cause? We
hardly know, but we know that there was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>a people, a race, a class which was not thus
inspired with the passion for change of
domicile. The Germans entitle that period
the time of the great Folk-wandering. We
are in the midst of such another Folk-wandering,
but it is not now the migration of
races and nations, but of classes and individuals;
the passion for change drives the
men and women out of the country to
towns, and the young out of their situations.
It is in the air, it is in their blood.</p>

<p class='c005'>The evening sun touched the western sea,
and flared up in a spout of fire. Then
Thomasine rose to her feet. Her red hair
had fallen, and she bent her arms behind her,
to do it up. Gorgeous that hair was in the
evening sun, it seemed itself to be on fire, to
be incandescent in every hair, and her
attitude as she stood on the step was grand,
her vigorous, graceful form, her splendid
proportions were shown in perfection, with
bosom expanded, and her hands behind her
head collecting and tying and twisting the
fire that rained off it. The evening sun was
full on her, and filled her eyes that she could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>see nothing; but her handsome face was
shown illuminated as a lamp against the cold
grey walls of the corn-chamber. Her
shadow was cast up the steps and against the
door, a shadow that had no blackness in it,
but the purple of the plum.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tamsin! my word, you are on fire!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She started, let go her hair, and it fell
about her, enveloping her shoulders and
arms in flame. Then she put one hand
above her eyes, and looked to see who addressed
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You here, Archelaus! What has
brought you to this lost corner of the world,
this time o’ day?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You, of course, Tamsin, what else?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish you’d choose a better time than
when I’m doing up my hair.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I could not wish a better time than when
you are in a blaze of glory.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The young man who spoke was Archelaus
Tubb, son of the captain of the slate quarry.
He was a simple, good-humoured, not clever
young man. Strongly built, with sparkling
eyes and a merry laugh, he was just such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>fellow as would have made his way in the
world, had he been endowed with wits. He
was not absolutely stupid, but he was muddle-headed.
He succeeded in nothing that he
undertook. He had been apprenticed to a
carpenter, and at the expiration of three
years was unable even to make a gate.</p>

<p class='c005'>He tried his hand at gardening, and dug
graves for potatoes, and put in bulbs upside
down. He had faculties, but was incapable
of applying them, or was too careless to call
them together and concentrate them on his
work. There seemed small prospect of his
earning wage above that of a day-labourer.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had fair hair, an honest face, always on
the alert for a laugh. As he had been unqualified
for any trade, his father had given him
work in the quarry, but therein he earned but a
labourer’s wage, fourteen shillings a week.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thomasine reseated herself on the lowest
step but one, and put her feet on the lowest,
and crossed her hands on her lap.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Arkie,” said she; “I am going away
from Court, the life here is too dull for me.
I want to see the world.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“Where are you going, Tamsin?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not to bury myself in a place where
nothing is doing, again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing doing! There is plenty of
work on a farm.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Work!” scorned Thomasine. “Who
wants work now? not I—I want to go where
there are murders and burglaries and divorces—into
a place where there is life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Queer sort of life that,” said Archelaus,
casting himself down on the lowest step.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want to be where those things are done
and talked about,” said Thomasine; “what
do I care about how the corn looks, and
whether the sheep have the foot-rot, and
what per stone is the price of bullocks?
Now—you need not sit on my feet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will choose a higher step,” said the
lad; then he stepped past her, and seated
himself on that above her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Upon my word, Tamsin,” he said, “you
have wonderful hair. It is like mother’s
copper kettle new scoured, and spun into
spiders’ threads. Some red hair,” continued
he, “is coarse as wire, but this,” he put his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>fingers through the splendid waves, “but
this——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is not for you to meddle with,” said
Thomasine. “Shall I make my fortune
with it in the world?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She stood up, and stepped past him, and
seated herself on the step immediately above
that he occupied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the world!” repeated Archelaus.
“What world—that where murders and
burglaries and divorces are the great subject
of talk?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aye—in the world where something is
doing, where there is life, not in the world
of mangold-wurzel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know, Tamsin,” said the lad
dispiritedly. “I hope not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not? I am not happy here. I
want to be where something is stirring.
Why,” said Thomasine with a flash of anger
in her cheek and eye and the tone of her
voice—“Why am I to be a poor farm girl,
and Miss Arminell Inglett to have all she
wishes? She to be wealthy, and I to
have nothing? She to be happy, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>wretched? I suppose I am good-looking,
eh, Arkie?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course you are,” said he, “but,
Tamsin, I cannot talk to you as you are
behind me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not care to see your face,” said the
girl, “the back of your collar and coat are
enough for me. Is that your Sunday wide-awake?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—what have you against it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only that there is a hole in it, there”—she
thrust her finger through the gap in the
crown, and touched his scalp.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know there is, Tamsin; a coal bounced
on to it from the fire.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Without bringing light to your brain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall change my place,” said Archelaus;
he stood up, stepped past the girl, and
seated himself above her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” said he, “I can look down on, and
seek for blemishes in your head.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will find none there—eh! Arkie?
Shall I make my fortune with my hair?
Coin it into gold and wear purple and fine
linen, and fare sumptuously every day? That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>is what I want and will have, and I don’t care
how I get it; so long as I get it. My head
and hair are not for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then she stood up, strode past Archelaus,
and planted herself on the step higher than
that he occupied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is a queer keeping company, tandem
fashion, and changing the leader,” laughed
Archelaus.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We are not keeping company,” answered
Thomasine. “Tandem is best as we are,
single best of all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t see why we should not keep company,”
said the lad.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do,” answered Thomasine sharply, “have
I not made it plain to you that I didn’t want
a life of drudgery, and that I choose to have
a life in which I may amuse myself?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let us try to sit on the same step,” said
Archelaus, “and then we can discuss the
matter together, better than as we are, with one
turning the back on the other.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is not room, Arkie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll try it at all events,” said he, as he got
up and seated himself beside her. “Now we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>are together, and can keep steady if one puts
an arm round the other.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will not be held by you,” said she, and
mounted to the step above; then she burst
out laughing, and pointed. “Do y’ look
there,” she said, “there is a keeping of company
would suit you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She indicated a pair that approached the
farm. The man was lame, with a bad hip,
and his right hand was furnished with two
fingers only—it was Samuel Ceely. His
maimed hand was thrust between the buttons
of his waistcoat, and on his right arm rested
the coarse red hand of Joan Melhuish.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do y’ look there!” exclaimed Thomasine,
“are they not laughable? They have been
courting these twenty years, and no nigher
marriage now than when they began; it might
be the same with us, were I fool enough to
listen and wait for what you offer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is no laughing matter,” said the lad, “it
is sad.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is sad that she should be such a fool!
Will his fingers grow again, and his hip right
itself? She should have looked about for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>another lover twenty years ago, now it is too
late, and I take warning from her. You,
Arkie, are like Samuel Ceely, not in body
but in wits, crippled and limping there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tamsin!” exclaimed Arkie, “you shall
not speak like that to me.” He stood up and
stepped to where she was, and seated himself
again beside her. That was on the highest
step, and they were now both with their backs
to the granary door. He tried to take her hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Arkie,” she said, “I speak seriously,
I will not be your sweetheart. I like you well
enough. You are a good tempered, nice
fellow, very good natured, and always cheerful,
but I won’t have you. I can’t live on
fourteen shillings a week, and I won’t live in
the country where there is nothing going on,
but cows calving and turnips growing.
There is no wickedness in either, and wickedness
makes life various and enjoyable. I can
read and write and cypher, and am tired of
work accordingly. I want to enjoy myself.
There is mistress!” she exclaimed, stood up,
stepped aside, missed her footing, and fell to
the bottom of the steps.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“Oh, Tamsin, if only you had let me hold
you!” cried Archelaus, and ran down to raise
her. “Then you would not have fallen.” She
had sprained her foot and could only limp.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER X.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>“SABINA GREEN.”</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>In the four-hundred-and-thirty-first number
of the <i>Spectator</i> is a letter from Sabina Green,
on the disordered appetite she had acquired
by eating improper and innutritious food at
school. “I had not been there above a
Month, when being in the Kitchen, I saw
some Oatmeal on the Dresser; I put two or
three Corns in my Mouth, liked it, stole a
Handful, went into my Chamber, chewed it,
and for two Months after never failed taking
Toll of every Pennyworth of Oatmeal that
came into the House. But one Day playing
with a Tobacco-pipe between my Teeth, it
happened to break in my Mouth, and the
spitting out the Pieces left such a delicious
Roughness on my Tongue, that I could not
be satisfied till I had champed up the remaining
Part of the Pipe. I forsook the Oatmeal,
and stuck to the Pipes three Months, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>which time I had disposed of thirty-seven
foul Pipes, all to the Boles. I left off eating
of Pipes and fell to licking of Chalk. Two
Months after this, I lived upon Thunderbolts,
a certain long, round, bluish Stone,
which I found among the Gravel in our
Garden.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell’s mental appetite was as much
disordered as the physical appetite of Sabina
Green. Whether Gaboriau’s novels bore
any analogy to the foul tobacco-pipes, we do
not pretend to say, their record of vice
certainly left an agreeable roughness on her
mental palate, but now without any intermediate
licking of chalk, she has clenched
her teeth upon a thunderbolt—a question
hard, insoluble, beyond her powers of mastication.
Besides, she was wholly unaware that
the thunderbolt had been laid in her path expressly
that she might exercise her teeth
upon it.</p>

<p class='c005'>A hundred and fifty years ago, Sabina
Green picked corns, licked chalk and
munched tobacco pipes, and the same thing
goes on nowadays. There are tens of thousands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>of Sabina Greens with their mouths
full, and with no appetite but for tobacco-pipes
or thunderbolts. We have advanced—our
pipes are now meerschaum—foam of the
sea.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have known young ladies who would
touch nothing but meringues, and thereby
seriously impair their constitutions and complexions.
We have known others who could
touch nothing but literary meringues, novels,
and whose digestion revolted at solid food,
but who crunched flummery romance at all
times of day and night, till the flummery invaded
their brains, filled their mouths, frothed
in their hearts; and then tired of sweets they
look out for what is pungent or foul—like the
old tobacco-pipes.</p>

<p class='c005'>An unwholesome trick into which German
women fall is that of “naschen,” of nibbling
comfits and cakes all day long. They carry
cornets of bonbons in their pockets, and have
recourse to them every minute. They suffer
much from disordered digestion, and fall into
the green sickness, because they lack iron in
the blood. How can they have iron in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>blood when they eat only sugar? Our
English girls have a similar infirmity, they
nibble at novels, pick at the unsubstantial, innutritious
stuff that constitutes fiction all day
long. Do they lack iron in their moral
fibre? Are their souls bloodless and faint
with the green sickness? How can it be
other on a diet of flummery?</p>

<p class='c005'>The stomach of the nibbler never hungers,
only craves; the appetite is supplanted by
nausea. The symptoms of disorder are permanent;
languor of interest, debility of
principle, loss of energy in purpose, a disordered
vision, and creeping moral paralysis.</p>

<p class='c005'>If Arminell had reached the condition of
one of these novel-nibblers, what she had
heard would have produced no effect upon
her heart or brain because neither heart nor
brain would have been left in her. But she
had not been a habitual novel-reader, she had
read whatever came to hand, indiscriminately;
and the flummery of mere fiction would never
have satisfied her, because she possessed,
what the novel-nibblers do not possess, intelligence.
No control had been exercised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>over her reading, consequently she had read
things that were unsuitable. She had a
strong character, without having found outlets
for her energy. A wise governess would
have tested her, and then led her to pursuits
which would have exerted her ambition and
occupied her interest; but her teachers had
been either wedded to routine or intellectually
her inferiors. Consequently she had no
special interests, but that inner eagerness and
fire which would impel her to take up and
follow with enthusiasm any object which excited
her interest. Her friends said of
Arminell with unanimity that she was a disagreeable
girl, but none said she was an
empty-headed one.</p>

<p class='c005'>On reaching the house, Arminell found
that lunch was over, and that her father had
gone out. He had sauntered forth, as the
day was fine, to look at his cedars and pines
in the plantations, and with his pocket-knife
remove the lateral shoots. Lady Lamerton
was taking a nap previous to the resumption
of her self-imposed duties at Sunday-school.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was indisposed to go to school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>and afternoon service in the church. After a
solitary lunch she went upstairs to the part of
the house where was Giles’ school-room.
She had not seen her brother that day, and
as the little fellow was unwell, she thought
it incumbent on her to visit him.</p>

<p class='c005'>She found the tutor, Giles Inglett (<i>vulgo</i>,
Jingles) Saltren, in the room with the boy.
Little Giles had a Noah’s Ark on the table,
and was trying to make the animals stand on
their infirm legs, in procession, headed by
the dove which was as large as the dog, and
half the size of the elephant.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Saltren sat by the window looking
forth disconsolately. The child had a heavy
cold, accompanied by some fever.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you wish to leave the school-room,
Mr. Saltren,” said Arminell, “I am prepared
to occupy your place with the captive.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thank you, Miss Inglett,” answered
the tutor. “But I have strict orders to go
through the devotional exercises with Giles
this afternoon, the same as this morning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will take them for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“You are most kind in offering, but having
been set my tale of bricks to make
without straw, I am not justified in sending
another into the clayfield, in my room.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I see—this is a house of bondage to you,
Mr. Saltren. You hinted this morning that
you meditated an <i>in exitu Israel de Egypto</i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The young man coloured.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You tread too sharply on the heels of
the <i>pied de la lettre</i>, Miss Inglett.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you feel this, though you shrink
from the expression of your thoughts. You
told me yourself this forenoon that you were
not happy. If you leave us, whither do you
propose going?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A journey in the wilderness for forty
years.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“With what Land of Promise in view?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have set none before me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“None? I cannot credit that. Every
man has his Land of Promise towards which
he turns his face. Why leave the leeks and
onions of Goshen, if you have but a stony
desert in view as your pasture? I suppose
the heart is a binnacle with its needle pointing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>to the pole—though each man may have
a different pole. South of the equator, the
needle points reversedly to what it pointed
north of it. An anchor, an iron link, a nail
even may divert the needle, but to something
it must turn.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Inglett—had Moses any personal
hope to reach and establish himself in the land
flowing with milk and honey, when he led
Israel from the brick-kilns? He was to die
within sight of the land, and not to set foot
thereon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Mr. Saltren; who are your Israel?
Where are the brick-kilns? Who are the
oppressors?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can you ask?” The tutor paused and
looked at the girl. “But I suppose you
fail to see that the whole of the civilised
world is an Egypt, in which some are task-masters
and others slaves; some enjoy and
others suffer. Miss Inglett—you have
somehow invited my confidence, and I
cannot withhold it. It is quite impossible
that the world can go on as it has been,
with one class drawing to itself all that life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>has to offer of happiness, and another class
doomed to toil and hunger and sweat,
and have nothing of the light and laughter of
life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell seated herself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” she said, “as Giles is playing
with his wooden animals, trotting out the
contents of his ark; let us turn out some of
the strange creatures that are stuffed in our
skulls, and marshal them. I have been
opening the window of my ark to-day, and
sending forth enquiries, but not a blade of
olive has been brought to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As for the ark of my head,” said the
tutor with a bitter smile, “it is the reverse
of that of Noah. He sent forth raven and
dove, and the dove returned, but the raven
remained abroad. With me, the dark
thoughts fly over the flood and come home
to roost; the dove-like ones—never.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am rather disposed,” said Arminell,
laughing, “to liken my head to a rookery in
May. The matured thoughts are a-wing and
wheeling, and the just fledged ones stand
cawing at the edge of their nests, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>fluttering wings, afraid to fly, and afraid to
stay and be shot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To be shot?—by whom?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps, by your wit. Perhaps by my
lord’s blunderbuss.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will not level any of my poor wit at them.
Let your thoughts hop forth boldly that I
may have a sight of them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>An exclamation of distress from Giles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the matter?” asked Arminell,
turning to her brother.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The giraffe has broken his leg, and I
want him to stand because he has such a long
neck.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you were manly, Giles, you would not
say, the giraffe has broken his leg, but—I
have broken the giraffe’s leg.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I did not, Armie. He had been
packed too tightly with the other beasts, and
his leg was so bent that it broke.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mend it with glue,” she advised.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can’t—it is wrong to melt glue on
Sunday. Mamma would not like it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The conversation had been broken along
with the giraffe’s leg, and neither Arminell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>nor young Saltren resumed it for some time.
Presently the girl said, “Mr Saltren, do you
know what sort of men Addison called
Fribblers? They are among men what flirts
are among women, drawing girls on and then
disappointing them. There are plenty of
flirts and fribblers in other matters. There
are flirts and fribblers with great social and
religious questions, who play with them, trifle
with them, hover about them, simulate a lively
interest in them, and then—when you expect
of them a decision and action on that decision,
away they fly in another direction, and shake
all interest and inquiry out of their thoughts.
I have no patience with such flirts or fribblers.”
She spoke with a little bitterness.
She was thinking of her step-mother. The
tutor knew it, but did not allow her to see
that he did.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you not think,” he said, “that they
fribble from a sense of incompetence to grapple
with these questions? The problems interest
them up to a certain point. Then they see
that they are too large for them, or they entail
consequences they shrink from accepting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>consequences that will cost them too dear, and
they withdraw.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Like the young man in the Gospel
who went away sorrowful for he had great
possessions. He was a fribbler.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Exactly. He was a fribbler. He was
insincere and unheroic.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I could not fribble,” said Arminell vehemently.
“If I see that a cause is right, I
must pursue it at whatsoever consequence to
myself. It is of the essence of humdrum to
fribble. Do you know, Mr. Saltren, I have
had a puzzling problem set before me to-day,
and I shall have no rest till I have worked it
out? Why is there so much wretchedness, so
much inequality in the world?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why was Giles’ giraffe’s leg broken?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell looked at him with surprise, suspecting
that instead of answering her, he was
about to turn off the subject with a joke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The world,” said Saltren, “is like Giles’
Noah’s Ark, packed full—over full—of
creatures of all kinds, and packed so badly
that they impinge on, bruise, and break each
other. Not only is the giraffe’s leg broken,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>but so are the rim of Noah’s hat and the ear
of the sheep, and the tusk of the elephant. It
is a congeries of cripples. We may change
their order, and we only make fresh abrasions.
The proboscis of the elephant runs into the
side of the lamb, and Noah’s hat has been
knocked of by the tail of the raven. However
you may assort the beasts, however
carefully you may pack them, you cannot prevent
their doing each other damage.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Saltren turned to little Giles and
said:—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bring us your box of bricks, my boy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is Sunday,” answered the child.
“Mamma would not wish me to play with
them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not wish to make a Sabbath-breaker
of you,” answered the tutor, “nor are your
sister and I going to do other than build Babel
with them—which is permissible of a Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The little boy slid off his seat, went to his
cupboard, and speedily produced the required
box, which he gave to Mr. Saltren.</p>

<p class='c005'>The tutor drew forth the lid. The bricks
were all in place compacted in perfect order.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Then he said, with half-sneer, half-laugh,
“There are no gaps between them. The
whole assemblage firm as it were one block.
Not a breakage anywhere, not room for a
breakage.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said Arminell, “of course not.
They all fit exactly because they are all cubes.
The bricks,” she laughed, “have no long
necks like the giraffe, or legs or horns, or proboscis,
or broad-brimmed hats, liable to be
broken. Of course they fit together.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you shake the ark—the least concussion
produces a breakage, one or two beasts suffer.
You may toss the box of bricks about; and
nothing is hurt. Why?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was impatient. “Of course the
reason is plain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The reason is plain. <i>The bricks are
all equal.</i> If it were so in the world of
men, there would be no jars, no fractures,
no abrasions, but concord, compactness,
peace.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell said nothing. She closed her
eyes and sat looking at the bricks, then at the
animals Giles had arranged.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>The tutor said no more, but his eyes,
bright and eager, were on the girl’s face.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently Arminell had gathered her
thoughts together sufficiently to speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That, then, is the solution you offer to
my problem. But to me it does not seem
solved. There the animals are. They are
animals—and not bricks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They are animals, true, but they must be
shaken and shaken together, till all their
excrescences are rubbed away, and then they
will fit together and find sufficiency of room.
That is how marbles are made. Shapeless
masses of stone are put in a bag and rattled
till all their edges and angles are rattled off.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What an ark would remain! You complain
of some animals crippling others, this
scheme of yours would involve a universal
mutilation—the animals resolved into undistinguishable,
shapeless, uninteresting
trunks. The only creature that would come
out scatheless would be the slug. All the
rest would be levelled down to the condition
of that creature—which is a digesting
tube, and nothing more.” Then Arminell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>stood up. “It is time for me to be off,” she
said; “her ladyship will be back from
church, and oh! Mr. Saltren, I have interfered
with the Psalms and Lessons.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>According to the classic story, the Sphinx
demanded of all who visited her the solution
of an enigma—and that enigma was <i>Man</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly, unexpectedly, on a quiet ordinary
Sunday morning, Arminell, a young
girl without experience, had been confronted
with the Sphinx, and set the same enigma,
an enigma involving others, like the perforated
Chinese puzzle-balls, an enigma that
has been essayed and answered repeatedly,
yet always remains insoluble, that, as it has
assumed fresh aspects, has developed new
perplexities. Arminell had been wearied
with the routine and restraint of social life,
its commonplace duties and conventionalities,
and had been fired with that generous
though mistaken dislike to the insincerities
and formalities of civilisation, so often found
among the young—generous, because bred of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>truth; mistaken, because it ignores the fact
that the insincerities impose on no one, and
the formalities are made of mutual compromises,
such as render life, social life,
possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was in this rebellious mood,
when she was brought face to face with a
problem beyond her powers to unravel.
She might as well, with a rudimentary knowledge
of algebraic symbols, have been set to
work out Euler’s proof of the Binomial
Theorem. She was like Fatima when she
opened Blue-Beard’s secret chamber, and
saw in it an array of victims. Of these
victims disclosed to her, one was Jingles,
another Patience Kite; then came Captain
Saltren and his wife; and next hung in the
dismal cabinet of horrors, Samuel Ceely and
Joan Melhuish. The world was indeed a
Blue-Beard’s room. If you but turned the
key you saw an array of misery and tearful
faces, and hearts with blood distilling from
them. It was more than that—it was a box
with a Jack in it. She had touched the
spring, and a monster had flown up in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>face, not to be compressed and buttoned
down again.</p>

<p class='c005'>How could the facts of existence be
reconciled with the idea of Divine Justice?
On one side were men and women born to
wealth and position and happiness; on the
other, men and women denied the least of
the blessings of life. Why were some of
God’s creatures petted and pampered, and
others kicked about and maltreated? Was
the world of men so made from the beginning,
or had things so come about through
man’s mismanagement, and if so, where was
the over-ruling Providence which governed
the world? When the Noah’s Ark arrived
new from the great toy-shop whence issue
the planets and spheres, were all the figures
round and fitted together, only afterwards in
the rearrangement to impinge on and
mutilate each other? Or had they been all
alike in the beginning and had developed
their horns and proboscises, their tusks and
broad-brimmed hats? Life is a sort of
pantomime, that begins with a fairy tale,
leads to a transformation scene, and ends,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>perhaps, with low comedy. In a moment
when we least expect it, ensues a blaze of
light, a spectacular arrangement of performers,
and then, away fall the trappings of
splendour, and forth, from under them, leap
out harlequin, clown, and pantaloon. The
knights cast off their silver armour, the
fairies shed their gauzy wings, kings and
queens depose their crowns and sceptres, and
there are revealed to us ordinary men and
women, with streaks of paint on their faces,
and patches of powder in their hair, perpetrating
dismal jokes, the point of which we
fancy is levelled at ourselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>To some men and women the transformation
scene arrives late in life, but to all inevitably
at some time; and then when the
scene on the stage before us is changed, a
greater transformation ensues within.</p>

<p class='c005'>When we were children we believed that
everything glittering was gold, that men
were disinterested and women sincere. The
transformation scene came on us, perhaps
with coruscations of light and grouping of
colours and actors, perhaps without, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>went by, leaving us mistrustful of every
person, doubtful of everything, sceptical,
cynical, disenchanted. Is not—to take a
crucial case—marriage itself a grand transformation
scene that closes the idyl of youth,
and opens the drama of middle age? We
live for a while in a fairy world, the flowers
blaze with the most brilliant colours, the air
is spiced as the breezes of Ceylon, angels
converse with men, and sing æthereal music,
manna floats down from heaven, containing
in itself all sweetness; sun and moon stand still
o’er us, over against each other, not to witness
a conflict, as of old in Ajalon, but to brighten
and prolong the day of glamour. Then the
bride appears before us, as Eve appeared to
Adam, unutterably beautiful and perfect and innocent,
and we kneel in a rapture, and dare
not breathe, dare not speak, nor stir; and
swoon in an ecstasy of wonder and adoration.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then tingle the marriage bells. The transformation
scene is well set with bridesmaids
and orange-blossoms, and a wedding breakfast,
postboys with favours, and a shower of
rice, and then—?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>The fairy tale is over. The first part of
the pantomime is over. The colours have
lost their brilliancy, the flowers shrivel, the
scents are resolved into smells of everyday
life, broiled bacon, cabbage water, and the
light is eclipsed as by a November fog. The
men for the way-rate, the water-rate, and the
gas-rate are urgent to have a word with us.
There descend on our table at every quarter
most bitter bills—those of the butcher and
the green-grocer, the milliner’s little account,
and the heavy itemless bill from the doctor.
What shall we say about our Eve, the beautiful,
the all-but divine, the ideal woman? The
all-but divine turns out to have a touchy
temper and a twanging tongue, falls out with
her cook, dismisses her, and consequently
serves you cold mutton and underboiled
potatoes.</p>

<p class='c005'>The transformation is complete, and how
does it leave us? In a rage at our folly?
Cursing our idealism? Rasped and irritable?
Withdrawing more and more from the society
of our Eve, and our Eden turned to an espalier
garden, to our club? So it is in many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>cases. The transformation scene is a trial,
and certain ones there are that never recover
the shock of disenchantment; but there are
others, on the other hand, who endure, and
to them comes in the end a reward. These
continue to sit in their box, listless, paring
their nails, turning the programme face downwards.
Half contemptuously, wholly void of
interest, they lend a dull ear to what follows,
and look on with a wondering eye, convinced
that the rest is farce and buffoonery and a
vexation of spirit, which must however be sat
through; then, little by little fresh interests
arise, tiny new actors invade the stage, with
sweet but feeble voices, saying nothing of
point, yet full of poetry. The magic begins
to work once more, the little fingers weave a
spell that lays hold of heart and brain, and
conjures up a new world of fantasy. The
flowers re-open and flush with colour, the
balmy air fans our jaded faces, again the
songs of angels reach our ears, the clouds
dispel, the manna falls, Eve resumes her
beauty, not the old beauty of childlike innocence
and freshness, but that of ripened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>womanhood, of sweet maternity, of self-command
and self-devotion.</p>

<p class='c005'>We sit hushed with our head in our hands,
and look with intense eye, and listen with
sharpened ear, and the tears rise and run
down our cheeks. We have forgotten the
old Eden with its fantastic imaginations, in
the more matured, the richer, the fuller, and
above all the more real paradise that is now
revealed.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the case of Arminell Inglett there was
no enchantment of colour, no setting of
tableau, for the transformation scene; it
came on her suddenly but also quietly. In
one day, on a quiet country Sunday, when
she walked out of the dull and stuffy school,
she passed, as it were, through a veil, out of
childland into the realm of Sphinx.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the evening, after a dull dinner, instead
of remaining in the drawing-room with my
lady, who had taken up a magazine, Arminell
put a shawl over her head and shoulders,
went forth into the garden, and thence to the
avenue.</p>

<p class='c005'>The evening was pleasantly warm, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>weather beautiful; beneath the trees the dew
did not fall heavily. A new moon was shining.
The girl thought over what she had
heard and seen that day—over the troubles
and wrongs of Captain Saltren, driven from
his occupation, and yet chained to the house
that was his own, and with which he would
not part; over the defiant scepticism of
Patience Kite, at war in heart with God and
man; over the suffering lives of Samuel and
Joan, united in heart, yet severed by fate, looking
to a common grave as the marriage bed,
and Arminell felt almost contempt for these
latter, because they accepted their lot without
resentment. She thought over what young
Mr. Saltren had said about his own position,
and she was able to understand that it was
one of difficulty and discomfort.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then she turned her mind to the Sunday-school,
where, whilst outside of it, within the
narrow confines of Orleigh parish, there was
so much of trouble and perplexity, my lady
was placidly teaching the children to recite as
parrots the names of the books of the
Apocrypha, which they were not to read for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>establishment of doctrine, and Captain Tubb
was enunciating arrant nonsense about the
names of the Sundays preceding Lent.</p>

<p class='c005'>The avenue was composed of ancient oaks.
It was reached from the garden, which intervened
between the house and it. The avenue
was not perfectly in line, because the lay of
the land did not admit of its being carried at
great length without a curve, following the
slope of the hill that rose above it, and fell
away below in park-land to the river.</p>

<p class='c005'>The walk was gravelled with white spar.
It commanded an exquisite view down the
valley of the Ore, over rich meadow-land and
pasture, dotted with clumps of trees, beech,
chestnut, and Scotch pine. A line of alders
marked the course of the river, to where, by
means of a dam, it had been widened into a
lake. On the further side of the river, the
ground gently rose in grassy sweeps to the
wooded hills. To the south-west the river
wound away about shoulders of richly-clothed
hills, closing in on each other, fold on fold.
The avenue was most delightful in the evening
when the setting sun gilded the valley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>with its slant beams, turned the trunks of the
pines scarlet, and cast the shadows of the
park trees a purple blue on the illuminated grass.</p>

<p class='c005'>Oaks do not readily accommodate themselves
to form avenues, they are contorted,
gnarled, consequently oak avenues are rarely
met with. That at Orleigh had the charm of
being uncommon.</p>

<p class='c005'>The evening was still, the sky was full of
light, so much so that the stars hardly showed.
The light spread as a veil from the north,
from behind the Orleigh woods, and reflected
itself in the dew that bathed the grass.
Arminell was attached to this walk, in great
measure because she could at almost all times
saunter in it undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had not, however, on this occasion,
been in it half an hour, before she saw her
father coming to her. He had left his wine;
there were, as it happened, no guests in the
house, and he and the tutor had not many
topics in common.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Armie!” he said, “I have come
out to have a cigar, and lean on you. My
lady told me I should find you here.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“And, papa, I am so glad you have come,
for I want to have a word with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“About what, child?” Lord Lamerton
was a direct man—a man in his position must
be direct to get through all the business that
falls to him, business which he cannot escape
from, however much he may desire it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa,” said Arminell, “it is about the
Saltrens.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What about them?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you give up the manganese—what is
Captain Saltren to do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stephen will find work somewhere, never
fear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But he cannot leave his house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That he will have to sell; the railway
company want to cross Chillacombe at that
point. He will get a good price, far beyond
the value of the house and plot of land.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa—must the manganese be given
up?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course it must. I have no intention
of allowing myself to be undermined.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But it is so cruel to the men who worked
on it.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“Manganese no longer pays for working.
There has been a loss on the mine for the
last five years. We are driven out of the
market by the Eiffel manganese. The
Germans work at less wage, and our men refuse
to have their wage reduced.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what are the miners to do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They were given warning that the mine
would be closed, as long as five years ago;
and the warning has been renewed every
year since. They have known that they
must seek employment elsewhere. They will
have to go after work, work will not come to
them—it is the same in every trade. All
businesses are liable to fluctuations, some to
extinction. When the detonating cap was
invented, the old trade of flint chipping on
the Sussex downs began to languish; with
the discovery of the lucifer match it expired
altogether. When adhesive envelopes were
introduced, the wafer-makers and sealing-wax
makers were thrown out of work, and the
former trade was killed outright. I was wont
to harvest oak-bark annually, and put many
hundreds of pounds in my pocket. Now the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Americans have superseded tan by some
chemical composition, and there is no further
sale for bark. I am so many hundreds of
pounds the poorer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, papa, that is true enough, but you
have a resisting power in you that others
have not. You have your rents and other
sources of income to fall back on; these poor
tradesmen and miners and artizans have none.
I have read that in Manitoba the secret of
the magnificent corn crops is found in this,
that the ground is frozen in winter many feet
deep, and remains frozen in the depths all
summer, but gradually thaws and sends up
from below the released water to nourish the
roots of the wheat, which are thus fed by an
unfailing subterranean fountain. It is so
with you, you are always heavy in purse and
flush in pocket, because you also have your
sources always oozing up under your roots.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Armie, my subterranean source—the
manganese—is exhausted; for five years
instead of being a source it has been a sink.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whereas,” continued Arminell, “the
poor and the artizan lie on shelfy rock, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>shallow soil above it. A drought—a week of
sun—and they are parched up and perish.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear girl, the analogy is false. The
difference between us is between the rooted
and the movable creature. Do not they live
on us, eat us, consume our superfluity?
We are vegetables—that root in the soil,
and the tradesmen and artizans nibble and
browse on us. The richer our leaf, the more
succulent our juices, the more nutriment we
supply to them. When they have eaten us
down to the soil, they move off to other
pastures and nibble and browse there.
When we have recovered, and send up fresh
shoots, back they come, munch, munch,
munch. If one supply fails, others open.
There is equipoise—I dare say there are
twice as many hands employed in making
matches and adhesive envelopes now, as
there were of old chipping flints and making
wafers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That may be, but the drying up of one
spring before another opens must cause distress.
Where is that other one, that the
necessitous may drink of it? Ishmael was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>dying of thirst in the desert on his mother
Hagar’s lap, within a stone’s throw of a well
of which neither knew till it was shown them
by an angel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course there is momentary distress,
but the means of locomotion are now so
great that every man can go about in quest
of work. Things always right themselves in
the end.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They do not right themselves without the
crushing and killing of some in the process.
Tell me, papa, how is this to be explained?
I have to-day encountered two poor creatures
who have loved each other for twenty years,
and are too abject in their poverty to be able
even now to marry. No fault of either
accounts for this. Accident, misfortune,
divide them—such things ought not to be.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But they are—they cannot be helped.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They ought not to be—there must be
fault somewhere. Either Providence in
ruling destinies rules them crooked, or the
social arrangements brought about by
civilization are to blame.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here, Armie, I cannot follow you. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>am content with the providential ordering of
the world.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course you are, papa, on fifty thousand
a year.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You interrupt me. I say I am content
with the social structure as built up by
civilization.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have no doubt about it—you are a peer.
But what I want to know is, how do the
providential and social arrangements look to
the Fredericks with the Empty Pockets, not
what aspect they wear to Maximilian and Le
Grand Monarque. Do you suppose that
Captain Saltren is content that his livelihood
should be snatched from him; or Patience
Kite that her father and mother should have
died, leaving her in infancy a waif; or
Samuel Ceely, that he should have blown
off his hand and blown away his life’s happiness
with it, and dislocated his hip and put
his fortunes for ever out of joint thereby, so
as to be for ever incapacitated from making
himself a home, and having a wife and little
children to cling about his neck and call
him father?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“Old Sam was not all he ought to have
been before he met with his accidents.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor are any of us all we ought to be.
Papa, why should it have fallen to your lot to
have two wives, and Samuel Ceely be denied
even one?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Upon my word, Armie, I cannot tell.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not suppose you can see how those
are who live on the north side of the hill
always in shade and covered with mildew,
when you bask on the south side always in
sun, where the strawberries ripen early, and
the roses bloom to Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beg your pardon, child, I have had my
privations. We cannot afford to go to town
this season. I have had to make a reduction
in my rents of twenty per cent. I get
nothing from my Irish property, cannot sell
my bark, lose by my manganese. Are you
satisfied?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, papa, your privations are loss of
luxuries, not of necessaries. Those who have
been exposed to buffets of fortune, been
scourged by the cynical and cruel caprice
which rules civilized life, will rise up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>exact their portions of life’s pleasures and
comforts. They will say,—we will not be exposed
to the chance of being full to-day and
empty to-morrow, of working without hope—like
Samuel and Joan.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sam does not work.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is the fault of Providence which
blew off his hand and distorted his leg. I say,
the needy and the workers will ask why we
should be well-dressed, well-housed, well-fed,
hear good music, buy good pictures, ride
good horses——” her thoughts moved faster
than her words; she broke off her sentence
without finishing it. “Papa! why, at a meet,
should Giles have his pony and little Cribbage
run on his feet?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Upon my soul,” answered Lord Lamerton,
“I can’t answer in any other way than this—because
I keep a pony and the rector does
not for his little boy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, papa, I think the time must come
when you will have to justify your riding a
good hunter and wearing a red coat; and I
for wearing a tailor-made habit, whilst Miss
Jones has but a skirt.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“Look here, Armie,” said her father, “how
dense, how like snow the fog is lying on the
pasture by the water.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, papa, but——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is no fog here, on the higher
land.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, papa.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is frost below when there is none
here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, papa.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because that lies low, and this high.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But why should that lie low, and this
high?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course, because—it is the configuration
of the land.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But how unreasonable, how unjust, that
there should be such configuration of the
land, as you call it. There should be no
elevations and no depressions anywhere—a
universal flat is the landscape for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell winced. She saw the drift of
her father’s remarks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear,” he said, “there must be inequalities
in the social level, but I am not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>sure that these very inequalities do not give
charm and richness to the social picture.
Each level has its special flora. The marigold
and the milkmaid and the forget-me-not
love the low moist bottom where the
fog and frost hang, and will not thrive here.
Those ups and downs, those hills and valleys
which so shock your sense of fitness, are the
secret of richness, are the secret of fertility.
In equatorial Africa, Dr. Schweinfurth found
a dead level and perennial swamp. In Mid-Asia,
Huc traversed an Alpine plateau
absolutely sterile. It is a very unreasonable
thing to some that our moors should contain so
many acres of unprofitable bog, that they
should be sponges receiving, and growing
nothing. They say that we, the wealthy,
are these absorbing sponges, unprofitable
bogs of capital. But, my dear child, if the bogs
were all drained, all the water would run off
as fast as it fell. They retain the water and
gradually discharge it on the thirsty lowlands.
And so is it with us. We spend what we receive
and enrich therewith those beneath.
But come—I shall go in. I am feeling chilled.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“I will take another turn first,” said
Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t fret yourself, my dear,” said her
father, “about these matters. Take the
world as it is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa—that advice comes too late. I
cannot.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Lord Lamerton returned to the house; he
threw away his cigar-end, and went in at
the snuggery door, the door into the room
whither the gentlemen retired for pipes and
spirits and soda-water, a room ornamented
with foxes’ heads and brushes, whips, hunting-pictures,
and odds and ends of all sorts. He
shut the door and passed through it into that
part of the house in which was the school-room,
and Giles’ sleeping apartment. As he
entered the passage, Lord Lamerton heard
piercing shrieks, as from a child yelling in
terror or pain.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a moment, Lord Lamerton ran up the
stairs towards the bedroom of his son. The
nurse was there already, with a light, and
was sitting on the bed, endeavouring to
pacify the child. Giles sat up in his night-shirt,
in the bed clothes, with his eyes wide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>open, his fair head disordered, striking out
with his hands in recurring paroxysms of
terror.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the matter with him?” asked
the father.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My lord—he has been dreaming. He
has had one or two of these fits before.
Perhaps his fever and cold have had to do
with it.” Then hastily to Giles who began
to kick and beat, and went into a fresh
fit of cries, “There, there, my dear, your
papa has come to see you. Have you nothing
to say to him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>But the little boy was not to be quieted.
He was either still asleep, or, if awake, he
saw something that bereft him of the power
of regarding anything else.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There will be no questioning him, my
lord, till he is thoroughly roused,” said the
nurse.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bring me a glass of water.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Whilst the woman went for the tumbler,
Lord Lamerton seated himself on the bedside,
and drew the little boy up, and seated
him on his lap.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“Giles, my darling, what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the little fellow clung round his
father’s neck, and the tears broke from his
eyes, and he began to sob.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the matter, my pet, tell me?
Have you had bad dreams? Here, drink
this draught of cold water.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no, take it away,” said the child.
“I want papa to stay. Papa, you won’t be
taken off, will you? Papa, you will not
leave me, will you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, my dear. What have you been
thinking about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have not been thinking. I saw it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Saw what, Giles?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton stroked the boy’s hair; it
was wet with perspiration, and now his
cheeks were overflowed with tears. The
shrieks had ceased. He had recovered
sufficient consciousness to control himself;
“Papa, I was at the window.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What, in your night-shirt? After you
had been put to bed? That was wrong.
With your heavy cold you should not have
left your bed.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>The child seemed puzzled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa, I do not understand how it was. I
would not have left bed for the world, if I
thought you did not wish it; and I do not
remember getting out—still, I must have got
out; for I was at the window.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He has not left his bed. He has been
dreaming, my lord,” explained the nurse in
an undertone; and Lord Lamerton nodded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa, dear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, my pet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you listening to me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am all attention.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa, I was at the window. But I am
very sorry that I was there, if you are annoyed.
I will not do it again, dear papa.
And the moon was shining brightly on the
drive. You know how white the gravel is.
It was very white with the moon on it. I
did not feel at all cold, papa; feel me, I am
quite warm.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, my treasure, go on with your story.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I watched something black come
all the way up the drive, from the lodge-gates,
through the park. I could not at first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>make out what it was, but I saw that it was
something very, very black, and it came on
slowly like a great beetle. But when it was
near, then I saw it was a coach drawn by four
black horses, and there was a man on the box,
driving, and he was in black. There was no
silver nor brass mounting to the harness of
the horses, or I should have seen it sparkle
in the moonlight. And, dear papa, the coach
stole on without making any noise. I saw
the horses trotting, and the wheels of the
coach turning, but there was no sound at all
on the gravel. Was not that strange?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very strange indeed, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But there was something much stranger.
I saw that the horses had no heads, and also
that the coachman had no head. His hat
with the long weeper was on the top of the
carriage. He could not wear it because he
was without a head. Was not that queer?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very queer,” answered Lord Lamerton,
and signed to the nurse to leave the room.
His face looked grave, and he held the little
boy to his heart, and kissed his forehead with
lips that somewhat quivered.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“Then, papa, the carriage stopped at the
entrance, and I could see through the window
panes to the gravel with the moon on it, on
the other side, and there was no one at all in
the coach. It was quite, quite empty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you not think it was Dr. Blewett
come to see you, my little man?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, papa, I did not think anything about
whose coach it was. But when it remained
at the door, and no one got out, I saw it must
be staying for some one to enter it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And did any one come out of the house?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the little boy began to sob again, and
cling round his father’s neck, and kiss him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, my dear Giles?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, papa!—you will not go away!—I
saw you come out of the door, and you went
away in the coach—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I!” Lord Lamerton drew a sigh of relief.
The dream of the dear little fellow, associated
with his illness, had produced an uneasy effect
on his father’s mind—he feared it might portend
the loss of the boy, but if the carriage
waited only for himself—!</p>

<p class='c005'>“That, papa, was why I cried, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>frightened. You will not go! you must not
go!” The child trembled, clasping his father,
and rubbing his wet cheek against his father’s
face.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Lord Lamerton called the nurse from
the next room. “Master Giles,” he said, “is
not thoroughly roused. The current of his
thoughts must be diverted. Throw that thick
shawl over him. I will carry him down into
the drawing-room to my lady, and show him
a picture-book. Then he will forget his dream
and go to sleep. Come for him in a quarter
of an hour.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The nurse did as required. Then Lord
Lamerton stood up, carrying his son, who
laid his head on his father’s shoulders, and so
he bore him through the passages and down
the grand staircase to the drawing-room. The
little fair face rested on the shoulder, with the
fair hair hanging down over the father’s back,
and one hand was clutched in the collar.
Lord Lamerton kissed the little hand. He
was not afraid of making the child’s cold worse,
the evening was so warm.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton was sitting on a settee with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>a reading lamp on a table at her side, engaged
on an article in one of the contemporary
magazines, on Decay of Belief in the World.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton was a good woman, who
on Sunday would on no account read a novel,
or a book of travels, or of profane history.
Her Sabbatarianism was a habit that had survived
from her childish education, long after
she had come to doubt its obligation or advisability.
But, though she would not read a
book of travels, memoirs or history, she had
no scruple in reading religious polemical
literature. On one Sunday she found that
miracles were incredible by intelligent beings,
and next Sunday she had her faith in the
miraculous re-established on the massive
basis of a magazine article.</p>

<p class='c005'>For an entire fortnight she laboured under
the impression that Christianity had not a
leg to stand on, and then, on the strength of
another article, was sure it stood on as many
as a centipede. For a while she supposed
that dogmas were the cast cocoons of a living
religion, and then, newly instructed, harboured
the belief that it was as impossible to preserve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>the spirit of religion without them as it
is to keep essences without bottles. At one
time she supposed the articles of the creed to
be the shackles of faith, and then that they
were the characters by which faith was decipherable.</p>

<p class='c005'>The sun was at one time supposed to be a
solid incandescent ball, but astronomers
probed it with their proboscises, and found
that the body was enveloped in sundry wraps,
which they termed photosphere and chromosphere,
and which acted as jacket and overcoat
to the body, which was declared to be
black as that of a Hottentot. Some fresh
proboscis-poking revealed the fact that the
blackness supposed to be the sun-core was in
fact an intervening vapour or rain of ash, and
when this was perforated, the very body of
the sun was seen, red as that of an Indian,
sullenly glowing, lifeless, almost lightless, a
cinder. Moreover, the spectroscope was
brought to analyse the constituents of the
photosphere and to determine the metals in a
state of incandescence composing it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton, looking through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>telescopes of magazine articles and reviews,
was continually seeing deeper into the great
luminous, heat-giving orb of Christianity;
was shown behind its photosphere, taught to
despise its chromosphere, and saw exhibited
behind them blackness, exhausted force, the
ash of extinct superstitions. The critical
spectroscope was, moreover, brought to bear
on Christianity, and to analyse its luminous
atmosphere, and resolve it into alien matter,
none distinctively solar, all vulgar, terrestrial,
and fusible.</p>

<p class='c005'>The astronomer assures us that the fuel of
the sun must fail, and then the world will
congeal and life disappear out of it, and the
critic announces the speedy expiring of
Christianity. But, as—indifferent to the fact
that the sun like a worn-out and made-up old
beau is tottering to extinction—Lady
Lamerton ordered summer bonnets, and laid
out new azalea beds, just so was it with her
religion. She continued to teach in Sunday-school,
went to church regularly, read the
Bible to sick people, did her duty in society,
ordered her household, made home very dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>to his lordship—in a word, lived in the light
and heat of that same Christianity which she
was assured, and by fits and starts believed,
was an exploded superstition. As Lord
Lamerton brought little Giles in his arms
into the drawing-room, he whispered in his
ear, “Not a word about the coach to mamma,”
and Giles nodded.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton put her book aside and
looked up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Lamerton! What are you doing?
The boy is unwell, and ought to be in
bed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He has been dreaming, my dear; has
had the nightmare, and I have brought him
down for change, to drive the frightening
thoughts away. He will not take cold, he is
in flannel, and the shawl is round him. Besides,
the evening is warm.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He must not be here many minutes.
He ought to be asleep,” said his mother.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear, I have promised him a look at
a picture-book. It will make him forget his
fancies. What have you over there?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No Sunday stories or pictures, I fear.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Yonder is a book in red—illustrated.
What is it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Sintram’—it is not a Sunday book.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have not read it for an age, but if I
remember right, the D—— comes into it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If that be the case it is perhaps allowable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the meaning of that picture?”
asked the little boy, pointing to the first in
the text. It was by Selous. It represented
a great hall with a stone table in the centre,
about which knights were seated, carousing.
In the foreground was a boy kneeling, beating
his head, apparently frantic. An old
priest stood by, on one side, and a baron was
starting from the table, and upsetting his
goblet of wine.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot tell, I forget the story, it must
be forty years since I read it. I have not my
glasses. Pass the book to your mother, she
will read.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton drew the volume to her,
and read as follows:—“A boy, pale as death,
with disordered hair and closed eyes, rushed
into the hall, uttering a wild scream of terror,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>and clinging to the baron with both hands,
shrieked piercingly, ‘Knight and father!
Father and knight! Death and another are
closely pursuing me!’ An awful stillness lay
like ice on the whole assembly, save that the
boy screamed ever the fearful words.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is not a pretty story,” said Lord
Lamerton uneasily.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa,” whispered the boy, “I did not
think that anything was following me. I
thought”—his father’s hand pressed his
shoulders—“no, papa, I will not repeat it to
mamma.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Giles?” asked his mother,
looking up from the book.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing but this, my dear,” answered
Lord Lamerton, “that I told Giles not to
talk about his dreams. He must forget them
as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is that priest doing?” asked the
child, pointing to the picture.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton read further. “‘Dear
Lord Biorn,’ said the chaplain, ‘our eyes and
thoughts have all been directed to you and
your son in a wonderful manner; but so it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>has been ordered by the providence of
God.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think, Giles, we will have no more of
‘Sintram’ to-night. Let us look together at
the album of photographs. I will show you
the new likeness of Aunt Hermione.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where is young Mr. Saltren?” asked
Lady Lamerton.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I fancy he has gone to see his mother.
If I remember aright, he said, after dinner,
that he would stroll down to Chillacot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There comes nurse,” said Lady Lamerton.
“Now, Giles, dear, you must go to
sleep, and sleep like a top.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will try, dear mamma.” But he clung
to and kissed most lovingly, and still with a
little distress in his flushed face, his father.
He had not quite shaken off the impression
left by his dream. When the boy was going
out at the door, keeping his head over his
nurse’s shoulder, wrapped in the shawl, Lord
Lamerton watched him lovingly. Then ensued
a silence of a minute or two. It
was broken by Lady Lamerton who
said—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“We really cannot go on any longer in
the crypt.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The crypt?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must build us a new school-room.
The basement of the keeper’s cottage is unendurable.
It did as a make-shift through
the winter, but in summer the closeness is
insupportable. Besides, the noises overhead
preclude teaching and prevent learning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will do what I can,” said Lord Lamerton;
“but I want to avoid building this
year, as I am not flush of money. Such a
room will cost at least four hundred pounds.
It must have some architectural character, as
it will be near the church, and must not be
an eyesore. I wish it were possible to set
the miners to build, so as to relieve them;
but they are incapable of doing anything
outside their trade.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What will they do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot say. They have not been
like the young larks in the fable. These
were alarmed when they overheard the
farmer and his sons discuss the cutting of the
corn. But the men have been forewarned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>and have taken no notice of the warnings.
Now they are bewildered and alarmed because
they are turned off.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Something must be done for them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been considering the cutting of a
new road to the proposed station; but the
position of the station cannot be determined
till Saltren has consented to sell Chillacot,
and he is obstinate and stupid about it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you cannot cut it till you know
where the station will be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Exactly; and Captain Saltren is obstructive.
I am not at all sure that his right to
the land could be maintained. I strongly
suspect that I might reclaim it; but I do
not wish any unpleasantness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course not. Is the road necessary?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not exactly necessary; but I suppose
work for the winter must be found for the
men. As we have not gone to town this
season, and if, as I propose, we abandon our
projected tour to the Italian lakes in the
autumn, I daresay we can manage both the
road and the school-room; but I need not
tell you, Julia, that I have had heavy losses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>My Irish property brings me in not a groat.
I have lost heavily through the failure of the
Occidental Bank, and I have reduced my
rents. I am sorry for the men. Cornish
mining is bad, or the fellows might have gone
to Cornwall. Perhaps if I find them work
on the new road, mines may look up next
year.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Arminell has been speaking to me about
Samuel Ceely. She wants him taken on,”
said her ladyship. “She will pay for him
out of her own pocket.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton’s mouth twitched. “Arminell
has asked me why I should have been
allowed two Lady Lamertons, and he not
one Mrs. Ceely.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Arminell is an odd girl,” said her ladyship.
“But I am thankful to find her take
some interest in the poor. It is a new phase
in her life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It seems to me,” said Lord Lamerton,
“that you and Armie are alike in one
particular, and unlike in another. You both
puzzle your brains with questions beyond
your calibre, you with theological, she with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>social questions; but you are unlike in this,
that you take your perplexities easily, Arminell
goes into a fever over hers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a bitter sorrow to me that I cannot
influence her,” said Lady Lamerton humbly.
“But I believe that no one devoid of definite
opinions could acquire power over her.
I see that so much can be said, and said with
justice on all sides of every question, that all
my opinions remain, and ever will remain, in
abeyance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I sincerely trust that the minx will not
fall under the influence of those who are
opinionated.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Arminell is young, vehement, and, as is
usual with the young, indisposed to make
allowance for those who oppose what commends
itself to her mind, or for those who do
not leap at conclusions with the same activity
as herself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And she is pert!” said Lord Lamerton.
“Upon my soul, Julia, it is going a little too
far to take me to task for having been twice
married. And again, when I said something
about my being content with the providential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>ordering of the world, she caught me up, and
told me that anyone with a coronet and fifty
thousand a year would say the same. I have
not that sum this year, anyhow. Girls nowadays
are born without the bump of reverence, and
with that of self-assurance unduly developed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Neither spoke for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently Lord Lamerton, who was looking
depressed, and was listening, said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hark! Is that Giles crying again?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I heard nothing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Possibly it was but my fancy. Poor little
fellow! Something has upset him. It was
unfortunate, Julia, our lighting on ‘Sintram.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>He stood up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not easy about the dear little creature.
Did you see, Julia, how he kissed me,
and clung to me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is very fond of you, Lamerton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I of him. I think I shall be more easy
if I go up and see our Sintram, and learn whether
he is asleep, or whether the bad dreams are
threatening him. Poor little Sintram!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will come back, Lamerton?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, dear, when I have seen and kissed
my little Sintram.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c004'>“Is it not a sad reflection,” said Lady Lamerton
on the return of his lordship, “that the
men who influence others are those of one
idea, in a word, the narrow? Because they
are <i>borné</i> in mental vision, ignorant and prejudiced,
they throw the whole force of their
wills in one direction, they become battering
rams, and the harder their heads the heavier
the blows they deal. If we have knowledge,
breadth of vision, charity, we cease to be
certain, are no longer bigots, and our power
of impressing others fails in proportion to our
liberality. I feel my own incompetence with
Arminell, but not with Arminell alone. I am
conscious of it when taking my Sunday class.
I dare insist on nothing, because I am convinced
of nothing. I am so much afraid of
laying stress on any religious topic, which has
been, is, or may be controverted, that I restrain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>myself to the explanation of those facts
which I know to be indisputable. I teach the
children that when Ahasuerus sent young men
with letters riding on dromedaries, these animals
had two humps; whereas when Rebekah
lighted down off her camel to meet Isaac, her
creature had but one hump. And I console
the dying with the last bulletins of the Palestine
Exploration Fund determining the site of
Ezion Geber. You know, my dear Lamerton,
that there are in the atmosphere nitrogen
which is the negative gas, oxygen which is
positive, and carbonic acid which is deleterious
to life. I suppose it is the same with the
spiritual atmosphere breathed by the soul,
only the oxygen is so hard—nay, to me so
impossible to extract, and I am so scrupulous
not to communicate any carbonic acid to my
scholars, that I fill the lungs of their souls
with nitrogen only—a long category of negatives.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What you teach matters little. The
great fact of your kindness and sympathy and
sense of duty remains undisturbed, unassailable,”
said Lord Lamerton.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“My dear,” said her ladyship, “I wish I
could be of more use than I am; but I am
like Mrs. Quickly in the ‘Merry Wives of
Windsor,’ who held commissions simultaneously
for Doctor Caius, Slender and
Fenton, and wished each and all success in
his suit for sweet Anne Page. I am not a
power, or anything appreciable, because my
judgment hangs ever in suspense and flickers
like a needle in a magnetic storm. When I
hear our dear good rector lay down the law
with thump of cushion in the pulpit, I know
he is thoroughly sincere and that sincerity is
the outcome of conviction. All this emphasis
would go were he to read such-or-such an
article in the <i>Westminster Review</i>, because
his conviction would be sapped. But, without
his conviction would he be of much use?
Would he carry weight with his rustic audience?
They value his discourses as the
Israelite valued the strong blast that brought
quails. If his mighty lungs blew nothing but
vagueness, would they care to listen, or if
they listened would they pick up anything
where nothing was dropped? I am sure that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>the great leaders of men were men of one
idea. Look at the apostles, illiterate fishermen,
but convinced, and they upset heathendom.
Look at Mahomet, an epileptic madman,
believing absolutely in only one thing—himself,
and he founded Islam. Calvin, Luther,
St. Bernard, Hildebrand, all were men of one
idea, allowing of no <i>Ifs</i> and <i>Buts</i> to qualify.
That was the secret of their strength. It is
the convex glass that kindles a fire, not that
which is even.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The narrow can only influence the
ignorant.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The narrow will always influence the
bulk of men, for the bulk of mankind is
ignorant, not perhaps of the three R’s, but of
the compensating forces which keep the
social and political systems from flying to
pieces.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank heaven, Julia, the country is not
in the hands of fanatics to whirl her to
destruction.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How long will it remain so? There are
plenty of hot-brained Phaethons who think
themselves capable of driving the horses of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the sun, and who have not yet learned to
control themselves. To my mind, Lamerton,
our class is the fly-wheel that saves the
watch from running down at a gallop, and
marking no progress at all. In the chronometer
the balance-wheel is made up of two
metals with different powers of contraction
and expansion, one holds the other in check,
and produces equilibrium. The wheel oscillates
this way, that way, and acts as a controlling
power on the mainspring, and modifies
the action of the wheels. Our class is so
constituted with its double character, is so
brought into relation with all parties in
politics, is so associated with every kind of
interest in the country, that it is swung this
way, that way, is kept in perpetual vibration,
and acts as an effective regulator on the
violent forces in the political and social
world—forces confined, and strong because
confined, forces which keep the machine
going, but which uncontrolled would wreck
it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dare say you are right, Julia. I have
no doubt the social classes are all as, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>where they ought to be, superposed as
geologic strata, but wonderfully contorted, it
must be allowed, in places. To change the
subject—what have you said to Arminell
about that fellow for whom she pleaded?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Samuel Ceely?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, that is his name.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is a poor creature,” said Lady
Lamerton, “a cripple.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If I remember right he was a scamp at
one time and got into one or two scrapes,
but what they were, ’pon my soul I do not
remember.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is harmless enough now,” said Lady
Lamerton. “I have him on my list of
those for whom I pay into the shoe-club, and
the clothing-club, the blanket and the coal
clubs. The rector’s wife said it was a pity
he should miss the advantages, which he
must do, as he is too poor to pay, and he
needs them more than many who receive
them. So I have him on my list of those
for whom I pay. I have told Arminell that
he can work in the glen. That requires to
be done up, it has been neglected for so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>many years. The paths and summer-house,
the benches, the water-fall, are all out of
order. Giles may like to play there. Arminell
will pay the man out of her allowance,
it is her own wish. And now, Lamerton,
I also will change the subject, and that
to one which I am not sure I ought to
mention on a Sunday. I am glad for one
thing, that we do not go to town for the
season, as it will enable us to show some
civility to the country people, the squires and
the parsons. Really, when we have the
house full of our friends, we cannot do it,
the groups do not amalgamate, they have so
few subjects in common. I have thought of
a garden-party for Wednesday week. You
will mind and make no engagements for that
day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will book it—to be at home on Wednesday
week.” Lord Lamerton seated himself,
and the light of his wife’s reading lamp
fell on his face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you not feeling well?” she asked.
“You look pale, dear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is nothing,” he replied. “I may have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>caught a slight chill in the avenue, as no
doubt the dew is falling, and there are no
clouds in the sky. The night is very still
and lovely, Julia. No—I think not—no, I
cannot have been chilled there. I do not
know what it is. Well—I will not say that
either. To tell you the whole truth, I am
worried.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Worried? About what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am uneasy, for one thing, about Arminell.
She has got queer fancies in her
head. Giles also is not well; and there is
something further—in itself nothing, but
though a trifle it is distressing me greatly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The leaders of my choice pines, which
I had planted about the grounds, have been
maliciously cut off. The thing has been
done out of spite, and to hurt me, and yet
the real sufferers are yet unborn. A hundred
years hence these trees would have
been admired for their stateliness—and now
they are mutilated. I shall be dead and
forgotten long before any tree I have put in
comes to size. I am pained—this has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>aimed at me, to wound me. I fear this has
been done because I have refused to allow
my house to be undermined.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who can have done it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know. If I did know, I would
not prosecute. That is one of the privileges
of our privileged class—to bear injuries and
impertinences without resentment. I am
hurt—I am hurt greatly. The matter may
be a trifle”—his lordship stood up—“but—after
all I have done for the Orleigh people—it
does seem unkind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton put out her hand, and
took that of her husband. “Never mind,”
she said; “he who did it will come to regret
it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The injury does not touch the Lamertons
alone,” said his lordship; “we throw open
the park and gardens every Saturday to the
public, and we allow Bands of Hope, and
Girls’ Friendly Societies, and Choirs, and all
sorts of agglomerations of men to come here
and picnic in our grounds and strew them
with sandwich papers and empty gingerbeer
bottles, and cut their initials on the park gates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and trees. A century hence the trees that
have been mutilated would have grown into
magnificence, and overshadowed heaven
knows what—political, social or religious holiday-taking
companies and awkward squads.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Put in some more pines, next autumn.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What with rabbits and the public, planting
is discouraging work. It costs a lot of
money, and you get no satisfaction from it.
My dear Julia, it is one of the privileges—no—drawbacks
of our class, that we expose a
wide surface to the envious and the evil-disposed.
They can injure us in a thousand
ways, whereas our powers of self-protection
are unduly limited. If we try to save
ourselves, we do ourselves injury, as pigs
when swimming cut their own throats with
their fore-claws.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind that. Whom shall we
invite,—or rather, whom must we omit? I
must send out cards of invitations to our
garden party at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, bother the garden party,” said his
lordship wearily. “You and I hardly ever
get a quiet evening together, so now that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>have one, let us forget the world outside and
some of these exacting and embarrassing
duties we owe it. Really, I envy those who,
belonging to a less conspicuous sphere, have
their cosy evenings at home, their privacy
and peaceful joys. We are forced to live in
publicity, we have to fill our house with guests,
lay ourselves out to entertain them, keep a
French cook for them—I am sure boiled
mutton and caper sauce would content me,—stock
our cellars for them, keep hunters and
preserve the game for them. Upon my
word, Julia, we are not suffered to live for
ourselves. A selfish existence is with us impossible.
No monks or nuns ever gave up
half so much, and lived so completely for
others, continually sacrificing their own
pleasures, leisure, thoughts, time, to others,—as
we, the British aristocracy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are out of spirits to-night, Lamerton.”
His wife retained his hand, and pressed it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then,” continued his lordship, following
his own train of thought, and not answering
his wife’s remark, perhaps because he did not
hear it, so full was his mind of the topic then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>uppermost in it, “then, Julia, consider—we
are mounted specimens; like those unfortunate
worms in sour paste, and monsters
in a drop of dirty water, we were shown by
lime-light and a magnifying glass the other
evening at the National School, projected
on a white sheet. The whole room was
crowded, and the bumpkins in the place sat
gazing as the lecturer pointed to the wriggling
creatures, named each in succession, and
described it. What must have been the discomfort
to those animals, if in any degree
sensitive, to be exposed, stared at, glared
through, commented on! and—consider—the
lecturer may have misinterpreted them,
because misunderstanding them, and they
listened to it all, squirmed a little more painfully,
but were incapable of setting him to
rights. The German princes are entitled
<i>durch-laucht</i>, that is, ‘Transparencies;’ and
quite right. We also are transparencies, we
worms of the aristocracy, monsters of
privilege, held up before the public eye,
magnified, projected on newspaper sheets,
characterised sometimes aright, more often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>wrongly, forced to have every nerve in our
system, every pulsation in our blood, every
motion in our brains, every moment in our
lives, and every writhe of our bodies and
spasm of our hearts commented on by the
vulgar, and brutally misunderstood. It is
rather hard on us, Julia. There are other
worms in the sour paste of life, other
monsters in the drop of dirty water we call
Society, who are at liberty to turn about, and
stretch themselves, bound or coil as they list;
only we—we must live and wriggle between
two plates of glass, illuminated and made
translucent by the most powerful known light,
denied that privilege which belongs to the
humble—opacity.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it the injured pines that have put you
out of spirits to-night, Lamerton?” asked my
lady, stroking the hand she held.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you ever read about Matthew
Hopkins, the witch finder?” asked his lordship,
with a fluttering smile on his lips.
“He brought many poor harmless creatures
to a violent end. Every suspected witch
was stripped and closely examined for a mole,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>a wart, for any blemish,—and such blemishes
were at once declared to be the devil’s seals,
stamping the poor wretches as his own.
Then they were tied hand and foot together,
and thrown into the water; if they sank they
were pronounced innocent; if they floated
they were declared guilty and were withdrawn
from the water to be delivered over to
fire. We, Julia, are treated in a way not unlike
that pursued by Matthew Hopkins; and
there are ten thousand amateur witch-finders
searching us, tearing off our clothes, peering
after defects, chucking us into the water or the
fire. If we are found to have moles, how we
are probed with lancets, and plucked with
tweezers, and then we are cast to the flames
of public indignation and democratic wrath.
If, however, we are found to have no moles
about us, if we give no occasion for scandal,
then away we are pitched into water, and
down down we sink in public estimation, and
chill disregard, as coroneted nonentities.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton continued to caress her
husband’s hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then again,” he continued, after a short
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>silence, “the witches were tortured into confession
by sleeplessness. They were seated
on uncomfortable stools, and watched night
and day. If they nodded, their soles were
tickled with feathers, cold water was poured
down their backs, or pepper was blown up
their noses. As for us, it is the same, we are
not allowed to live quietly, we are forced to
activity. I am kept running about, giving
prizes at school commemorations, taking seat
on committees, laying foundation-stones,
opening institutions, attending quarter sessions,
throwing wide my doors to every one,
my purse to a good many; I am denied
domesticity, denied rest. I am kept in perpetual
motion. I have a title, that means
every one else has a title to bully me. I am
tickled into energy if I nod, or the pepper of
journalistic sarcasm is blown into my eyes
and nose to stir me to activity. Julia, a rich
merchant, or banker, or manufacturer, a well-to-do
tradesman lives more comfortably than
do we. In the first place, they can do what
they will with their money—but we have to
meet a thousand claims on what we get, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>are grudged the remnant we reserve for our
individual enjoyment. Next, they are not
exposed to ruthless criticism, to daily, hourly
comment, as are we. They are free, we are
not; they can think first of themselves, afterwards
of others, whereas we have to be for
ever considering others, and thrusting ourselves
into corners, thankful to find a corner
in which we may possess and stretch our individual
selves. Upon my soul, I wish I had
been born in another order of humanity, without
title, and land, and a seat in the Upper
House, and—and without manganese.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If it had been so—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If it had been so, then I could have enjoyed
life, stuck at home, and seen more of you,
and Arminell, and dear little Giles, and then—why
then, I would have had no enemies.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton had reseated himself when
he began to talk of Matthew Hopkins, the
witch-finder. Now he stood up again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Julia,” he said, “those Douglas pines had
made noble shoots—it is a pity. I shall go
to bed, and dream, if I can, that I am lying
in clover and not over a bunch of manganese.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XIV.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>MR. JAMES WELSH.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Saltren had informed Arminell that
she had a brother who was a gentleman. The
term “gentleman” is derived from the Latin
<i>gens</i>, and signifies a member of a patrician
family. But this is not the signification now
given it in the vernacular. On the tongue of
the people, a gentleman and a lady are those
who do no manual labour. A man informs
you that he will be a gentleman on a bank-holiday,
because he will lounge about with his
hands in his pockets, and an old woman who
has weeded turnips at ninepence a day becomes
a lady when rheumatism invades her
limbs, and sends her to the union.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. James Welsh, the brother of Mrs.
Saltren, was a gentleman in this, that he belonged
to a <i>gens</i>, a class not ancient or aristocratic,
but modern, and one that has obtained
considerable influence, wields much power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>and is likely to become dominant—we mean
that of the professional journalist and politician.
He was a gentleman also in this, that
he did no hard manual labour, but few men
worked harder than he, but then he dirtied
his hands with ink only.</p>

<p class='c005'>Along the coasts of Scotland and Sweden
are terraces raised high above the sea-level,
which are pronounced by geologists to be
ancient beaches. At one time the waves
washed where now sheep graze, and deposited
sea-weed and shells where now grow heather
and harebells. There are these raised sea-beaches
in man, to which conscience at one
time reached, where it formed a barrier, and
whence it has retreated. But we are wrong
in speaking of the retreat of the sea, for
actually the level of the ocean is permanent,
it is the land which rises, and as it rises
leaves the sea below. And so perhaps it is
with us. We lift ourselves above old convictions,
scruples, principles, and the sometimes
sleeping, sometimes tossing sea of conscience
no longer touches those points they
once fretted. Do we congratulate ourselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>on this elevation? Perhaps so, and yet few
of us can contemplate the raised beaches left
in our hearts by the retiring waves of conscience
without a sigh, and a doubt.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. James Welsh said and wrote and did
many things as a public journalist and a professional
politician which as a boy or young
man he would have looked upon as dishonest,
false, and mischievous. His conscience no
longer troubled him in his business, but in
home relations he was blameless.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps one reason why the sea-level alters
with us, is that we are always endeavouring
to reclaim land from it, thrusting our sea-walls
of self-interest further out, to take in
more field from being overwashed. We
make our line of conscience co-terminous with
our line of self-interest. Outside this line the
waves may toss and roar, within they may not
cast a flake of foam, or waft a breath of ozone.
How much thunder and buffet we permit outside
our sea-wall of self-interest against any
rock or sand-bank that stands unenclosed!
but we only suffer the water of self-reproach
to sweep with a shallow swash and soothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>murmur the outside of the bank we have cast
up.</p>

<p class='c005'>What excellent words those are to conjure
with and wherewith blind our own eyes as well
as those of others—Political Party and The
Public Weal! We regard ourselves as devoted
to the <i>respublica</i>, when, in reality, we
care only for our private interests; and our
zeal for the public good is hot or cold according
as our dividends are affected.</p>

<p class='c005'>If we can show that the welfare of our
party can be advanced by making out our
neighbour to be a thief and assassin, with
what pious energy do we set to work to invent
lies to defame him. How we suppress
and disguise facts which make against our pet
doctrines! To what subterfuges and tricks
do we have recourse to colour those facts
which cannot be suppressed, to make them
look the opposite to what we know them to
be!</p>

<p class='c005'>It is really deserving of note how every
dirty and dishonourable act is wrapped about
with a moral sanction, as a comfit with a
motto in a cracker.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>We always profess to be actuated by noble
and disinterested motives, and yet they are
generally mean and personal. Our ancestors
regarded the planets only so far as they by
their conjunctions and interferences with each
other’s houses affected the constitutions and
careers of these ancestors of ours. Jupiter is
1250 times larger than the earth, and has
seven moons, and this planet with its moons
revolves and illumines the sky to affect the
spleen of Master Jack Sparrow and disturb
the courtship of Mistress Jenny Wren. Jupiter
is distant five-hundred millions of miles
from Jack and Jenny—but what of that?
According to Euclid a straight line can be
drawn between any two given points, accordingly
between the planet at one end and these
little nobodies at the other, lines exist. Now
all people actually do draw invisible lines between
themselves and every other object in
heaven and earth, and contemplate these objects
along these lines, and value and despise
them according as these objects affect them
along these lines.</p>

<p class='c005'>The author was travelling in a second-class
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>railway-carriage on that memorable
Monday morning after the Phœnix-Park
tragedy that thrilled all England with horror
and rage. Facing him, sat a gentleman
reading his paper, who ever and anon slapped
his knee, and exclaimed, “Famous! Splendid!
Nothing better could have happened!”
Presently, unable to understand these exclamations,
the author asked, “Sir! do you
mean to say that you approve of the crime?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no!” was his answer. “Certainly
not, but, consider how it will make the
papers sell! I have shares in one or two.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The writer was talking the other day to a
timber merchant on the condition of Ireland.
“I trust,” said he, “that the Plan of
Campaign will not be suppressed as yet.
We can buy Irish oak at fourpence a foot
just now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The writer was discussing the annexation
of Alsace with a native farmer. “Well,”
said he, “when we belonged to France I
sold for a franc what I now sell for a
mark, <i>therefore</i>, God save Kaiser Wilhelm.”
“But,” was objected, “probably you now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>have to pay a mark for what formerly cost
you a franc.” He considered for a moment,
and then said, “That is true, vive la
France!” Twopence turned his patriotism
this way to Berlin, or that way to Paris. He
was a German when selling, a Frenchman
when buying, all for twopence.</p>

<p class='c005'>The professional politician is a man who
lives by politics as the professional chess-player
lives by chess. He acquires a professional
conscience. His profession has to
fill his pockets and find bread for his children,
and politics must be kept going to do so.
The chess-player sacrifices pawns to gain his
end. The stoker shovels on coals into the
furnace to make his engine gallop; and the
electrician pours vitriol into the battery to
produce a current in his wires. They have
none of them the slightest scruple in doing
these things—they belong to the business,
and the professional politician has no scruple
in playing with facts, and throwing them
away as pawns in his game, or of exciting
the passions and prejudices of men, or of
using the most biting and corroding acid in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>his endeavours to evoke a current of feeling.
When an organist desires to produce a noise,
he pulls out stop diapason, and dances on the
pedals. The professional politician deals
with the public in the same way; that is his
instrument. What in the organ are the
pedals for but to be kicked, and the keys but
to be struck, and the stops but to be drawn
out, and what are the social classes but the
manuals, and the individuals composing
them, but the keys, and the grudges, greed,
ambition, envy, and prejudices but the stops,
which a clever player understands to manipulate?</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh was a worthy man, eminently
respectable, a good husband, and a kind
friend. He was truthful, honest, reliable in
his family and social relations, but professionally
unscrupulous. The sea-line stood
in its old place on one side of his character,
but on another a wide tract, that tract on
which he grew his harvest, had been reclaimed
from the waves of conscience. It is
so with a good many others besides Mr.
Welsh, and in a good many other trades and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>professions than journalism and politics. We
are conscientious in every department except
that of money-making, and in that we allow
of tricks and meannesses, which we excuse to
ourselves as forced on us by the exigencies
of competition. Recently Mr. Welsh had
been slightly indisposed, so he came from
town into the country, on a holiday, to
spend the Sunday with his sister, and then
run on to see a congenial friend in a town in
the same county.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the afternoon he took a stroll by himself
in the woods, smoking his pipe, and,
always with an eye to business, looking about
him for material for an article.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Halloo!” said Mr. Welsh, halting in
front of the ruinous cottage of Patience Kite.
“What have we here? Does any one inhabit
this tumble-down concern?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He went to the door and looked in.</p>

<p class='c005'>Patience faced him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you want? Who are you? This
is my house, and I will not be turned out of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She took him for a sanitary officer, or a
lawyer, come to enforce her expulsion.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“This is a queer hole for a lady to occupy
as her boudoir,” said Mr. Welsh, taking his
pipe out of his mouth. “I wouldn’t care for
this style of thing myself except as a drawing
copy. Not to become a hero of romance, or
to give my experience in a magazine article
would I sleep under that chimney on a
stormy night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nobody has invited you,” said Patience,
blocking her door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And pray, madam, whose house is this?
Is this the sort of cottage my lord provides
for his tenants?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The house is mine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Copyhold or freehold?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I pay a ground rent for it of two shillings;
it is mine for life, and then it falls to
his lordship.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should expect it would fall altogether
to you shortly. Why don’t you do it up?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How can I? I am poor.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suppose that you are bound by the
terms of the lease to maintain the house in
repair?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dare say. The agent, Mr. Macduff,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>has threatened me; but no one can make me
do it when I haven’t a shilling. You can’t
make one dance who is born without legs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, properly this house belongs to his
lordship. Why does not he do it up? I
can make something out of this! A Day in
the Country, something to fill a column and
a-half in a Monday morning paper. Contrast
his lordship’s princely residence with the ruins
in which he pigs his tenants. Compare
Saltren’s place, Chillacot, which is his own,
all in spic-and-span order, with this, and
then a word about the incubus of the great
holders on the land, and the advantage of
the enfranchisement of the soil. It will do.
And so, madam, they have tried to evict
you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; the sanitary officer ordered me to
leave, the Board of Guardians went to the
magistrates, and issued a summons to me to
quit, and my lord has sent Mr. Macduff to
me, to threaten proceedings against me if I
will not put the house in repair or quit it.
But what can they do when I won’t budge,
and could prosecute ’em if they laid fingers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>on me? The police daren’t touch me.
They’ve come and looked at me and argued,
but they can’t force me to leave.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So his lordship wants to evict you, eh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Macduff has declared he’ll send
masons and strip the roof, and pull down the
chimney, and rebuild the walls, but they
can’t do it without driving me out first, and
that is more than they can with me having
the house as my own for life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By Jove!” exclaimed Welsh, “it’s a
case—a poor widow, I suppose you are a
widow; it doesn’t matter if you are not; it
sounds best—a widow, a victim to his lordship’s
tyranny—tearing down the roof that
shelters her grey head, casting down her
chimney, desecrating her hearthstone, the
sacred penates, with the foot of violence—or
hoof, which shall it be? By George! I’ll
make something out of it, harrowing to the
feelings, and as rousing as tartaric acid and
soda! Who cares for a contradiction or a
correction? We can always break the lines
and make nonsense of it, and lay the
blame on the printer, if called to task. I’m
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>glad I came here for a Sunday. You will let
me inside, I suppose, ma’am, to cast an eye
round; particulars are so useful in a description,
lend such a <i>vraisemblance</i> to an account.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Mrs. Kite’s tumble-down cottage was
not the only material Mr. Welsh collected for
use on that Sunday. He heard from Saltren
about the stoppage of the manganese.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Something can be made out of that,”
said Welsh. “We are in want of a grievance.
Tell me the particulars, I’ll sift out
for myself what will serve my purpose.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When he had heard all, “It will do,” said
he, “there has been nothing to interest the
public or stir them up since the last divorce
suit in high life. High life!—so high that
some folks had to hold their noses. We
want a bit of a change now. After that bit
of strong venison, some capsicum to restore
the palate. Saltren, you must convene a
public meeting, make a demonstration, a
torchlight procession of the out-of-work, issue
a remonstrance. I’ll come and help you.
I know how to work those kind of things.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>A little grievance and some dissatisfaction
well-stirred together is like chlorate of potash
and sulphur in a mortar, only stir away, and
in the end you get an explosion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is of no use,” said the captain, in a
tone of discouragement.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of no use! I tell you it is of the utmost
use; we’ll make a public matter of it. Get a
question asked in the House about it. There
are so many journalists in there now that we
can get anything asked when we want the
question as a text for a leader. Why, we
will fill the papers with your grievance, only
we must have some meeting to report, and
I’ll help you with that. Bless you, I’ve half
a dozen ways of poking this matter into
notoriety; and we will show up the British
aristocracy as the oppressors of the poor,
those who are driving business out of the
country, who are the true cause of the
prevailing depression. Thanks to that recent
divorce case we’ve made them out to be the
moral cancer in the body of old England, and
now we shall show that they are the drag on
commercial progress. When folks are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>grumbling because the times are bad, it
makes them mighty content to be shown
a cause for it all, on which they may vent
their ill-humour. Did you ever read ‘The
Curiosity Shop,’ Saltren? Quilp had a
figure-head to batter whenever things went
wrong with him, and the public are much
like Quilp; give ’em an admiral or a peer, or
an archbishop, some figure-head, and whack,
bang, hammer, and smash they go at it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As for the aristocracy,” said Mrs.
Saltren, “I ought to know them. I combed
their hair, and hooked their dresses, and unpacked
their portmanteaus; and them as do
that are best qualified to know them, I should
think.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t mind telling you,” said the captain,
addressing his brother-in-law, “that their
doom is sealed in heaven. I’ve had it revealed
to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have, have you?” asked Welsh in a
tone of irony, which, however, Saltren did
not perceive.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I have—you shall hear. I would
not tell every one, but I tell you. I was in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>the spirit this very morning, and I heard a
voice from heaven, saying unto me, Saltren,
Saltren! Then I looked, and behold there
came flying down to me, a book from heaven,
written within and without. I held up my
hands to receive it; but it fell past me into
the water, and I stooped and looked thereon,
and saw written ‘The Gilded Clique,’ and
again the voice cried, ‘It is fallen, it is
fallen!’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t expect me to gulp that——”
Welsh checked himself, and added, shaking
his head—“I can’t, I’m afraid, make copy of
that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is true,” said Saltren earnestly. His
vehemence, his kindled eyes, his deepened
colour, showed his sincerity. “Would I dare
in such matters to utter lies? I am but a
poor mean instrument, but what of that?
Prophets have been found among shepherds,
and apostles taken from their fishing nets. I
was engaged in heartfelt prayer when this
took place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You didn’t happen to fall asleep, whilst
occupied in devotion, of course?” said Welsh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>with a contemptuous jerk of the chin. “Such
a weakness is not likely to befall you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was not asleep,” answered Saltren
sternly. “How could I be asleep, when my
eyes were open, and I saw the book; and my
ears, and they heard the voice?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You didn’t happen to get hold of the
book, and see the name of the publisher?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No—I was unable. It was unnecessary.
I read the title plainly. I saw what was on
the cover of the book.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can do nothing with this,” said Welsh,
leaning back in his chair, stretching, and
closing his hands behind the back of his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This belongs to another department
altogether. You had better relate your experiences
at the next revival-meeting among
the horse-marines, there is no knowing what
effect it may have upon that intelligent and
excitable body of men.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is true,” urged Saltren again, frowning.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was incapable of seeing that his
brother-in-law was bantering him. The man
was absolutely without sense of humour; but
he saw that Welsh did not believe in his story,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>and this irritated and offended him. That his
tale, as he told it, grew in its proportions and
became more and more unreal, was also what
he did not know. His mind worked on the
small materials it had, and spun out of them
a fable in which he himself implicitly believed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t dispute what you have narrated,”
said Welsh composedly. “I know you are a
total abstainer, so it is not to be accounted
for in the way which comes naturally uppermost.
Still, I’ve heard of wonderful elevation
of spirits and general head-over-heeledness
after an over-dose of non-alcoholic effervescing
liquors.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had touched nothing,” said Saltren,
with his temper chafed. “If you doubt
me——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I do not doubt you,” interrupted
Welsh. “I tell you that this does not
interest me, because it is outside my department,
like Bulgaria, and the Opera Comique,
and Inoculations for Hydrophobia, and
Primitive Marriage. I don’t meddle with
the Eastern Question, or review historical
works, or sermons, or novels. I leave all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>that to other fellows; you must pass this on
to the chap who does religion, not that I
think he would make copy out of it for a
magazine article, except under the head of
Hallucinations.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XV.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>REVELATIONS.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Now look straight for’ard,” said Mr.
Welsh, “and distinguish. You call this affair
of yours and the book—a revelation. There
are revelations, my friend, that may be
written with a capital R, and others that have
to begin with a small cap.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh was not particular about the
English he spoke, but he wrote it well, at
least passably.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The sort of revelation that suits me, one
with a capital R, is that at which a shorthand
reporter assists. That’s the sort of revelation
we get in the courts—that is, as the French
say, <i>controlé</i>. But on the other hand comes
your hole-and-corner revelation, which has
more given it than is its due when written
with a little <i>r</i>. No reporter, no public
present, totally uncontrolled; that sort of
revelation is no use to me. I don’t mean to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>say but that sort of thing may go down at
revivals, but for the press it is no good at all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Am I likely to have imagined it? What
should have put the thought of ‘The Gilded
Clique’ into my head?” asked Saltren
angrily. “I tell you I believe in this revelation
as I believe that I see you before me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gilded Clique!” repeated Welsh, “I
can’t say, but Gaboriau’s criminal novel may
have fallen under your eyes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A French novel with that title. It has
been translated.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now see!” exclaimed Captain Saltren,
kindling, springing up, and waving his arms,
“I never have set eyes on such a book, never
heard of it before. But nothing that you
could have said would have confirmed me in
my conviction more than this. It shows that
the devil is active, and that to draw away
attention from, and to weaken the force of
my revelation, he has caused a book to be
circulated under the same name. I should
not be surprised if you told me it had a blood-red
cover.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“It has one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There!” cried Saltren, “now nothing
will ever shake my faith. When the devil
strives to defeat the purposes of Heaven, it
is because he fears those purposes. My
solemn and sincere conviction is——” He
lowered his voice, but though low it shook
with emotion. “My belief is that the book
I saw was the Everlasting Gospel. John
saw an angel flying in heaven having that
book in his right hand, but it was not then
communicated to man. The time was not
ripe. Now, at last, towards the end of the
ages, that book has been cast down, and its
purport disclosed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You didn’t happen to see the angel?”
asked Welsh sneeringly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I—I am not sure, I saw something.
Indeed, there no doubt was an angel flying,
but my eyes were blinded with the extraordinary
light, and my mind has not yet
sufficiently recovered for me to recollect all
the particulars of the vision. But this I can
tell you, for I know it. Although I did not
get hold of the book, its contents are written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>in fire in my brain. That book of the Everlasting
Gospel declares that the age of
privilege is at an end, the distinctions between
rich and poor; noble and common, are at an
end. This has been hidden from the world,
because the world was not ready to receive
it. Now the time is come, and I am the
humble instrument chosen for announcing
these good tidings to men. I care not if,
like Samson, I be crushed as I take hold of
the pillars, and bow myself, and bring the
House of Lords down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Welsh, “if you can work
that line in the chapel, well and good. I
keep to my province, and that is the
manganese. Why, Condy’s fluid, I fancy, is
permanganate of potash—I can lug that in
somehow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah!” said Mrs. Saltren, who was becoming
impatient at having been left out of
the conversation, “at the park they thought
a deal about Condy’s fluid.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can manage it in this way,” said her
brother, rubbing his hands. “That disinfectant
has manganese as a constituent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>His lordship, by stopping the manganese
mine, cuts off a source of health, a deodorising
and disinfecting stream from entering the
homes of sickness, and the haunts of fever.
Who can say how many lives may be sacrificed
by the stopping of Wheal Julia? I’ll
bring in Condy’s fluid with effect. What
else is manganese used for?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bleaching, I believe,” said Mrs. Saltren.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah!” said Mr. Welsh, “that can be
worked in also, and I’ll pull old Isabelle of
Castile in by the ears as well. She vowed
she would not change her smock till a certain
city she was besieging had capitulated, and
as that city held out three months, judge the
colour of her linen. We are all, I presume,
to wear Isabelle shirts—or rather cuffs and
collars—and use Isabelle sheets and towels,
and eat off Isabelle tablecloths, and the
ministers of the Established Church to preach
in Isabelle surplices, because, forsooth, the
supply of manganese is withheld wherewith
to whiten them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, it does seem wrong,” said Mrs.
Saltren.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“And then,” continued her brother, kindling
with professional enthusiasm, “after that
divorce case, too, when the noble lords and
ladies washed their dirty linen in public.
You can figure how it will all work out.
Here is my Lord Lamerton knows that the
titled aristocracy have so much dirty linen at
home, that he is determined to prevent the
British public from wearing bleached linen
at all, lest they should perceive the difference.
There is nothing,” continued Welsh with a
chuckle, “nothing so convenient for one’s
purpose as well mixing one’s hyperboles and
analogies, and drawing just any conclusions
you like out of premises well muddled up
with similitudes. We know very well, my
dear Marianne, that the bread we buy of the
bakers is composed of some flour, and some
alum, and some plaster-of-paris, and some
china-clay, but we don’t stop to analyse it at
our breakfast; we cut ourselves a slice, butter
it, and pop it into our mouths, and like it a
thousand times better than home-made bread
made of pure unadulterated flour. It is just
the same with political articles and political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>speeches. There’s a lot of stuff of all sorts
goes into them besides the flour of pure
reason. And the British public don’t analyse,
they swallow. What they consume they
expect to be light and to taste agreeably—they
don’t care a farthing what it is made up
of.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh took out his pocket-book, and
jotted down his ideas. “Of course,” said he,
talking and laughing to himself, “we must
touch this off with a light hand in a semi-jocose,
and semi-serious manner. There are
some folks who never see a joke, or rather
they always see it as something grave.
They are like earth-worms—all swallow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh put up his knee, interlaced his
fingers round it, and began to swing his knee
on a level with his chest.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you want to rouse the British public,”
he said, “you must tickle them. You can’t
do much with their heads, but their feelings
are easily roused. Heads!—why there was
no getting wisdom out of the head of Jupiter,
till it was clove with an axe, and you would
not have the skull of the British public more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>yielding than that of the king of the gods.”
He put down his leg that he had been hugging.
“My dear sister,” he went on, “I
know the British public, it is my business to
study it and treat it. I know its moods, and
it is one of the most docile of creatures to
drive. There is one thing it loves above
anything, and that is a sore. Do you remember
how Aunt Susan had a bad leg, and
how she went on about that leg, the pride
she took in it, the medicines she swallowed
for it, and how she hated Betsy Tucker
because she also had a bad leg, and how she
contended that hers was the worst, the most inflamed,
and caused her most pain? It is so
with the public. It must have its sore; and
show it, and discuss it, and apply to it quack
plasters, and drink for it quack draughts.
What would the doctors do but for the Aunt
Susans and Betsy Tuckers—their fortunes
stand on these old women’s legs. So is it
with us—we live by the bad legs of the
nation. The public, in its heart of hearts,
don’t want those precious legs to be healed—certainly
not to be taken off. What we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>to do is to keep the sores angry with caustic,
and poked with needles. And that is just why
I want this manganese now, to rub it into the
legs of the public and wake the sores up into
irritation once more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Welsh began to whistle between his
front teeth and swing his foot again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The public,” he continued, “are like Job
on a dunghill, rubbing its sores. The public
has no desire to have the dunghill removed;
it rather likes the warmth. When it nods off
into a nap then we stick the prongs of the
fork into it, and up it starts excited and
angry, and we turn the heap over under its
nose, and then it settles down into it again
deeper than before.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I confess I do not know much about the
public,” said Mrs. Saltren, resolved to have a
word; “but when you come to the aristocracy,
why then you are on my ground.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“On your ground,” laughed Welsh,
“because you were lady’s maid at the Park;
that is like the land surveyor claiming a property
because he has walked over it with a
chain.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“At all events the surveyor knows it,”
said Mrs. Saltren, with some spirit, “perhaps
better than does the owner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I admit that you have me there,” laughed
her brother.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And,” said Mrs. Saltren, “it is pounds
on pounds I might have earned by sending
information about high life to the society
papers; but I was above doing that sort of
thing; besides, the society papers were not
published at that time. Sometimes there
were as many as a dozen or fourteen lady’s-maids
and as many valets staying in the house
with their masters and mistresses, and they were
full of the most interesting information and
bursting to reveal it, like moist sugar in a
paper-bag.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll tell you what it is,” said Welsh,
“servantdom is becoming a power in the
country, just as the press has become. There
is no knowing nowadays where to look for
the seat of power, it is at the other extremity
from the head. In old times the serfs and
slaves were not of account at all, and now
their direct representatives hold the characters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>and happiness of the best in the land in their
hands. The country may have at one time
been directed by its head; it is not so now,
like a fish, it is directed and propelled by its
tail. The servant class at one time was despised,
now it is feared; it mounts on its two
wings, the divorce court and the society
press. What opportunities it now has of paying
off old grudges, of pushing itself into
notoriety, of earning a little money. This is
the age of the utilisation of refuse. We find
an employment for what our forefathers, nay,
our fathers cast aside. The rummage of
copper mines is now burnt for arsenic, the
scum of coal-tar makes aniline dyes, and I
hear they are talking of the conversion of
dirty rags by means of vitriol into lump
sugar. It is so in social and political life—we
are using up our refuse, we invest it with
preponderating political influence, we chuck it
into the House of Commons, and right it
should be so; give everything a chance, and
in an age of transformation we must turn up our
social deposits. If it were not so, life would
be a donkey-race with the prize for the last.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“When I was companion to her ladyship,”
began Mrs Saltren, but was cut short by her
brother—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beg your pardon, Marianne, when was
that? I only knew you as lady’s-maid.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was more than that,” said Mrs. Saltren
flushing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, of course, lady without the maid.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I might, I daresay, have been my lady,
and have kept my maid,” said Mrs. Saltren,
tossing her head, “so there is no point in your
sneers, James. You may be a gentleman,
but I am a captain’s wife, and might have
been more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, indeed, and how came you not to be
more?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because I did not choose.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In fact,” said Welsh, “you thought you
were in for a donkey-race. By George, you
have got the prize!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are really too bad,” exclaimed Mrs.
Saltren, vexed and angry, “I could tell you
things that would surprise you. You think
nothing of me because I am not rich or grand,
and have to do the house work in my home;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>but I have been much considered in my day,
and admired, and sought. And I have had
my wrongs, which I thought to have carried
with me to my grave, but as you choose to
insult me, your sister, with saying I came in
last at a donkey-race, I will tell you that properly
I ought to have come in first.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I,” said Saltren, standing up, “I insist
on your speaking out.” He had remained
silent for some time, offended at his brother-in-law’s
incredulity, and not particularly interested
in what he was saying, which seemed
to him trifling.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let us hear,” said Welsh, with a curl of
his lips. He had no great respect for his
sister. “You must let me observe in passing
that just now you did not come in first
because you wouldn’t, and now, apparently, it
is because you weren’t allowed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have no wish,” said Marianne Welsh,
not noticing the sneer, “to make mischief,
but truth is truth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Truth,” interposed Welsh, who had the
family infirmity of loving to hear his own
voice, “truth when naked is unpresentable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>The public are squeamish, and turn aside
from it as improper; here we step in and
frizzle, paint and clothe her, and so introduce
her to the public.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you interrupt me, how am I to go on?”
asked Mrs. Saltren, testily. “I was going
to say, when you interrupted with your coarse
remarks, that at one time I was a great beauty,
and I don’t suppose I’ve quite lost my good
looks yet; and I was then very much sought.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what is more,” said Welsh, “to the
best of my remembrance you were not like a
slug in a flower-bed, that when sought digs
under ground.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I tell you,” continued Mrs. Saltren, with
heightened colour, “that I have been sought
by some of the noblest in the land.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Welsh looked out of the corners of his eyes
at his sister, and said nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was cruelly deceived. A great nobleman
whom I will not name—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whose title is in abeyance,” threw in
Welsh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whom I will not name, but might do so
if I chose, obtained a licence for a private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>marriage, and a minister to perform the ceremony,
and there were witnesses—the nuptials
took place. Not till several days after did I
discover that I had been basely deceived.
The licence was forged, the minister was a
friend of the bridegroom disguised as a parson,
and not in holy orders, and the witnesses
were sworn to secrecy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is your revelation, is it?” asked
James Welsh. “I write it with a small cap.,
and in pica print.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is truth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The truth, dressed, of course, and not in
tailor-made clothes. I dress the truth myself,
but—let me see, never allow of so much
margin for improvers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Welsh stood up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I must be off, Marianne, if I am to catch
the train. Saltren, keep the manganese in
agitation, I will be with you and set your
meeting going. Marianne, I can make no
more of your revelation than I can of that
disclosed by your husband. Facts, my dear
sister, in my business are like the wax figures
in Mrs. Jarley’s show. They are to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>dressed in the livery of our political colours,
and it is wonderful what service they will do
thus; but, Marianne, you can’t make the livery
stand by itself, there must be facts underneath,
it matters not of what a wooden and skeleton
nature, they hold up the garments. I can’t
say that I see in what you have told me any
supporting facts at all, only a bundle of
tumbled, theatrical, romantic rubbish.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XVI.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>HOW SALTREN TOOK IT.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Saltren, as already said, as Marianne
Welsh, had been good-looking and vain,
when lady’s-maid to the dowager Lady
Lamerton, the mother of the present lord.
She had never been in the park with Arminell’s
mother, as she had pretended. She
had been lady’s-maid only to the dowager,
and had left her service precipitately and
married Saltren a year before the marriage
of my lord. She had been vain, and thought
much of; her good looks were gone, her
vanity had not departed with them. Her
vanity had been wounded by the loss of her
husband’s esteem. She had harboured anger
against him for many years because of his
fantastic ideas, and straight-laced morality.
No one is perfect, she argued, and
Saltren, who pinned his religion on the Bible,
ought to have been the first to admit this.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>The just man falleth seven times a day, and
she had tripped only once in forty-two years—over
fifteen thousand days. If she could but
raise the veil and look into her husband’s past
life, argued she, no doubt she would see
comical things there. What if she had tripped?
Were not the ways of the world slippery?
Did she make them slippery? Had
she created the world and set it all over with
slides? And if a person did slip, was it becoming
of such a person to lie whimpering
where she had fallen? Did not that show
lack of spirit? For her part, after that slight
lapse, she had hopped on her feet, shaken
her skirts, and warbled a tune.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is a fact patent to every one, that the
further we recede from an object, the smaller
it appears. For instance, the dome of St.
Paul’s when we stand in St. Paul’s Churchyard,
looks immense. But as we stand on
Paul’s Wharf, waiting for a steamer, we already
discover that the small intervening
distance has diminished the dome to the size
of a dish-cover. As we descend the river,
the cupola decreases in proportion as we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>widen our distance from it, till it is reduced
to an inconsiderable speck, and finally
sinks beyond the range of our vision. It is
precisely the same with our faults. At the
moment of their commission, from under
their shadow, they look portentous and
actually oppress us; but they become sensibly
reduced in bulk the farther we drift down
life’s stream from them. What immeasurably
weighed on us yesterday, measurably
burden us to-day, and to-morrow are perceptible;
but the day after cease to discomfort
us. Not so only, but as we draw further
from our past fault, we look back on it with
a sort of fond admiration, tinged with sadness;
we lounge over the bulwarks of our
boat, opera-glass in hand, and consider it as
we consider the dome of St. Paul’s, as an
adjunct not altogether regretable in the retrospect;
for, consider how uniform, how insufferable
would be the landscape, without
breaks in the sky line.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Mrs. Saltren was embarked on the
same voyage with Stephen, her husband,
and naturally expected that the same object
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>which at one moment had obscured their sun,
but which rapidly diminished in size and importance
and signification to her eyes, should
equally tend to disappear from his. When,
however, she found that it did not, she was
offended, and harboured the conviction that
she was herself the injured party. Why
were not Stephen’s eyes constituted as the
eyes of other men? She had good occasion
to take umbrage at the perversity of his
vision. She had admitted at one time,
faintly, and with a graceful curtsey, a pretty
apology, and with that reluctance which a
woman has to confess a fault, that her
husband had been an injured man; but now,
after the lapse of over twenty years, their
relative positions were reversed. The cases
are known of girls who have swallowed
packets of needles. These needles inside
have caused at first uneasiness and alarm for
the consequences; but when they gradually,
and in succession, work out, some at the
elbows, some at the finger ends, some at the
nose, and in the end come all away, they
cease to trouble, and become a joke. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>so with our moral transgressions. When
committed, they plunge us in an agony of
remorse and fear; but gradually they work
out of us, point or head foremost, and finally
we get rid of them altogether. Now
Marianne Welsh and Stephen Saltren had
swallowed a packet of needles between them,
and they were all her needles which had
entered him. She did not retain hers long,
but as they worked out of her, they worked
into him and transfixed his heart, which
bristled with them, like a christening pin-cushion.
This, of course, was particularly
annoying to her. To forgive and to forget
is a Christian virtue, and Saltren, she argued,
was no better than a heathen, for all his profession,
because he neither forgot nor forgave.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Mrs. Saltren made the announcement
to her brother and husband, that a cruel
fraud had been committed on her, she had
acted without premeditation, stung to the
confession by her galled vanity at her
brother’s disrespectful tone, and with an indefined,
immatured desire of setting herself
to rights with her husband.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>The story had been contemptuously cast
back in her face by James Welsh; and it
was with some surprise and much satisfaction,
that she saw her husband ready to
accept it without question. Captain Saltren
had not offered to accompany his brother-in-law
to the station, which was four miles
distant; he could hardly wait with patience
his departure. No sooner was Welsh gone,
than Saltren grasped his wife’s arm, and said
in his deepest tones, “Tell me all, Marianne,
tell me all!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ought,” said Mrs. Saltren, recovering
herself from the confusion which she felt,
when her brother ridiculed her story, “I
ought at this day to wear a coronet of
diamonds. I was loved by a distinguished
nobleman, with ardour. I cannot say that I
loved him equally; but I was dazzled. His
family naturally were strenuously opposed to
our union; but, indeed, they knew nothing
at all about it. He entreated me to consent
to have our union celebrated in private. He
undertook to obtain a special licence from the
Archbishop. How was I to know that my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>simplicity was being imposed upon? I was
an innocent, confiding girl, ignorant of the
world’s deceit; and extraordinarily good-looking.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you did not reckon on the wickedness
of the aristocracy. Go on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Marianne paused. She was not ready
to fill up the details, and to complete her
narrative without consideration.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do not keep me in torture!” protested
Saltren, his face was twitching convulsively.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How could I help myself?” asked
Marianne. “It was not my fault that I had
such an exquisite complexion, such abundant
beautiful hair, and such lovely eyes; though,
heaven knows, little did I know it then, or
have I thought of, or valued it since. My
beauty is, to some extent, gone now, but not
altogether. As for my teeth, Stephen, which
were pearls—I had not a decayed one in my
jaws then; but after I married you they began
to go with worry, and because you did not
trust me, and were unkind to me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marianne,” said Saltren, “you deceived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>me—you deceived me cruelly. You told me
nothing of this when I married you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was always a woman of delicacy, and it
was not for me to speak. I had been deceived
and was deserted. Only when too
late did I find how wickedly I had been betrayed,
and then, when you came by and
found me in my sorrow and desolation, I
clung to your hand; I hoped you would be
my consolation, my stay, my solace, and I—I——”
She burst into tears. “I have been
bitterly disappointed. I have found you
without love, churlish, sullen, holding me
from you as if I were infected with the
plague, not ready to clasp me as an unhappy,
suffering woman, that needed all the love
and pity you could give.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not one word did you tell me of all this.
You let me marry you in unsuspicion that
before you had loved another.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all, Stephen,” she said, “I have
already assured you that I did not love the
man whom I so foolishly and unfortunately
trusted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why have you not told me this story
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>long ago? Why have you left me in the
dark so long?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your own fault, Stephen, none but yours.
If you had shown me that consideration
which becomes a professing Christian, I
might have been encouraged to open my
poor, tired, fluttering heart to you; but I
was always a woman of extreme delicacy, and
very reserved. You, however, were distant,
and cold, and jealous. Then my pride bade
me keep my tragic story to myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren stood before her with folded arms,
his hands were working. He could not keep
them still but by clasping them to his side.
“I was just, Marianne!” he said. “Just,
and not severe to judge. I judged but as I
knew the facts. If I was told nothing, I
knew nothing to extenuate your fault. You
were young and beautiful, and I thought that
perhaps you had not strong principles to
guide you. Now that you have told me all,
I allow that you were more sinned against
than sinning; but I cannot acquit you of not
entrusting me before this with the whole
truth.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“You never asked me for it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” he answered sternly. “I could
not do that. It was for you to have
spoken.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, all at once, Saltren began to
tremble; he took hold of the window-jamb,
and he shook so that the diamond panes in
the casement rattled. He stood there
quivering in all his limbs. Great drops
formed and rolled off his tall forehead, hung
a moment suspended on his shaggy brow and
then fell to the ground. They were not
tears, they were the anguish drops expressed
from his brain.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Saltren looked at him with astonishment
and some trepidation. She never had
comprehended him. She could not understand
what was going on in him now.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Stephen?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He waved his hand. He could not speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Stephen, what is it? Are you ill?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he threw himself before her, and
clasped her to him furiously, with a cry and
a sob, and broke into a convulsion of loud
weeping. He kissed her forehead, hair, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>lips. He seized her hands, and covered
them at once with tears and kisses.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marianne!” he said at last, with a voice
interrupted and choked. “For all these
years we have been divided, you and I, I and
you, under one roof, and yet with the whole
world between us. I never loved any but
you—never, never any; and all these long
years there has been my old love deep in my
heart, not dead, but sleeping; and now and
then putting up its hands and uttering a cry,
and I have bid it go to sleep again and lie
still, and never hoped that the trumpet
would sound, and it would spring up to life
once more. But why did you not tell me
this before? Why did you hide from me
that you were the sufferer, you the wronged?
If you would have told me this, I would have
forgiven you long ago. My heart has been
hungering and crying out for love. I have
seen you every day, and felt that I have
loved you, felt it in every vein. To me you
have not grown old, but have remained the
same, only there was this shadow of a great
darkness between us. I constrained myself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>because I considered you had sinned against
God and me, and were unworthy of being
loved!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again he drew her head to his shoulder,
laid it there, and kissed her, and sobbed, and
clasped her passionately.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marianne! Let him that is without
guilt cast the first stone. I forgive you.
Tell me that you loved me when I came to
you asking you to be mine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I did love you, Stephen—you and you
only.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And that other; he who—” he did not
finish the sentence—a fresh fit of trembling
came on him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never did love him, Stephen. Only
his title and his position impressed me. I
was young, and he was so much my superior
in age, in rank, in strength; and the prospect
opened before me was so splendid, that
a poor, young, trustful, foolish thing like
me—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You did not love him?” Stephen spoke
with eagerness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have assured you that I never did.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“Oh the age that we have spent together
under one roof, united yet separated; one in
name, apart in soul; years of sorrow to both
of us; years of estrangement; years of disappointed
love, and broken trust, and embittered
home—all this we owe to him!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marianne felt his heart beating furiously,
and his muscles contracting spasmodically in
his face, that was against hers, in his breast,
in his arms.</p>

<p class='c005'>Has it ever chanced to the reader to encounter
a married couple blind to each other’s
faults, and these faults glaring? One might
suppose that daily intercourse would have
sharpened the perception of each other’s
weaknesses, but instead of that it blunts it.
They cannot detect in each other the grotesque,
the ugly, the false, that are conspicuous
and offensive to everyone else. Love, it
is, which has softly dropped the veil over
their eyes, or withdrawn from them the faculty
of perceiving in each other these blemishes
which, if perceived, would make common
life unendurable. Love is well painted as
blind, but the blindest of all loves is the love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>of the married. In the case of the Saltrens
the blindness was on one side only, because
on his side only was there true love. This
had dulled his perception, so that he saw not
the shallowness, untruthfulness, vanity, and
heartlessness of Marianne, qualities which
her brother saw clearly enough.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have borne your wrong all these
years unavenged,” he said. “My God! how
I have misjudged you! One word more,
Marianne.” He disengaged himself from
her. He had been kneeling with his arms
enfolding her; now he released his hold, and
knelt, bolt-upright, with his hands depending
to the floor, gaunt, ungainly, motionless.
“Marianne,” he said, slowly, “I know so
much that I must be told all. I must know
the rest.” He paused for full a minute, looking
her steadily in the face, still kneeling upright,
stiffly, uncouthly. “Who was he?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Marianne did not speak. Now in turn
agitation overcame her. Had she gone too
far with this story, true or false?</p>

<p class='c005'>She raised her hands deprecatingly. What
would the consequences be?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Then, all at once, with a shriek rather than
a cry, Saltren leaped to his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You need not say a word. I know all
now, all—without your telling me. You
were in the park at the time with the old
Lady Lamerton, and—and you had the boy
named after him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Had there been light in the room, it would
have been seen how pale was the face of Mrs.
Saltren, but that of her husband, the captain,
had turned a deadlier white still.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It all unfolds before me, all becomes
plain!” he cried. “I wondered whose was
the head I saw on the book.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“On what book, Stephen?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I feared, I doubted, but now I doubt no
more. It was his likeness!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What book do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The book of the Everlasting Gospel
which I saw an angel carry in his right hand,
flying in the midst of heaven; and he cast
the book down, and the book was dipped in
blood; and when it fell into the water, the
water was turned to blood, as the river of
Egypt when Israel was about to escape.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>The door flew open, and Giles Inglett
Saltren entered, wearing a light coat thrown
over his evening dress. As he came in he
removed his hat.</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Saltren turned on him with flashing
eyes, and in his most sonorous tones said,
as he waved him away: “Go back, go back
whence you came. You have no part in me.
You are not my son. Return to him who
has cared for you: to him who is your father—Lord
Lamerton.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Giles Inglett Saltren stood motionless,
his hat in one hand, with the other holding
the door, looking at the captain. No lamp
had been lighted in the room since the sun
had set, and he could only see his father’s
face indistinctly by the pale evening sky light
cast in through window and door. But he
would have known from the tones of his
father’s voice that he was profoundly moved,
even if he had not caught the words he
uttered. At first, indeed, he was too surprised
to comprehend the full force of these
words; but, when their significance became
clear to him, he also became moved, and he
said gravely:</p>

<p class='c005'>“This must be explained.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What I said is quickly explained,”
answered the captain; and he rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>Does the reader remember a familiar toy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>of childhood composed of pretty birds, with
feathers stuck in them, strung on horsehair
or wires so as to form a sort of cage, but
with this difference, that the cage did not
contain the birds? When this toy was set
down, all the little figures quivered slowly,
uncertainly, to the bottom, and, when it was
reversed, the same process was repeated.
It was so with the captain’s speech. His
words were threaded on the tremulous strings
of his vocal organ, and not only quivered
from a high pitch down, but also went up
from a low one with much vibration on high.
A voice of this quality is provocative of sympathy;
as, when a violoncello string is touched,
a piano chord trembles responsive. Such
voices make not the voices, but the hearts of
other men to tremble. I know a slater who,
when I am ordering of him slates, brings
tears into my eyes by asking if I will have
“Duchess” or “Rag.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My words are quickly explained,” said
Stephen Saltren. “I have never regarded
you as my son—have never treated you as
such. You know that I have shown you no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>fatherly affection, because I knew from the
beginning that not a drop of my blood flowed
in your veins. But never, before this evening,
have I allowed you, or any one else, to
suspect what I knew, lest the honour of your
mother should suffer. Now, and only now,
has the entire truth been disclosed to me. I
did not suspect it, no, not when you were
christened and given the name you bear. I
thought it was a compliment paid through a
fancy of your mother’s to the family in which
she had lived, that was all. A little flickering
suspicion may have been aroused afterwards,
when his lordship, to save you
from consumption, sent you abroad; but I
put it angrily from me as unworthy of being
harboured. I had no real grounds for suspicion;
since then it has come up in my heart
again and again, and I have stamped down
the hateful thought with a kind of rage and
shame at myself for thinking it. Only to-night
has the whole story been told me, and
I find that your mother was not to blame—that
no real dishonour stains her—that all the
fault, all the guilt, lies on and blackens—blackens
and degrades his soul!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“I did not mean to say—that is, I did not
wish—” began Mrs. Saltren in a weeping,
expostulating tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marianne, say nothing,” Captain Saltren
turned to her. “It is not for you to justify
yourself to your child. The story shall be
told him by me. I will spare you the pain
and shame.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, mother,” said Jingles, shutting the
door behind him and leaning his back against
it, “I must be told the whole truth. I must
have it at least confirmed by your lips.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear,”—Mrs. Saltren’s voice shook—“I
would not make mischief, for the world.
I hate above everything the mischief-makers.
If there be one kind of people I abhor it is
those who make mischief; and I am, thank
heaven, not one of such.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quite so,” said her son, gravely; “but I
must know what I have to believe, for I must
act on it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, my dear, do nothing! Let it remain,
if you love me, just as if it had never been
told. I should die of shame were it to come
out.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“It shall not come out,” said Giles; “but
I must know from your lips, mother, whether
I am—I cannot say it. My happiness, my
future depend on my knowledge of what my
real parentage is. You can understand that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, then, it is true that you are not
Stephen Saltren’s son, and it is true that I
was a shamefully-used and deceived woman,
and that I had no bad intentions whatever.
I was always a person of remarkable delicacy
and refinement above my station. As for
who your father was, I name no names; and,
indeed, just now, when the captain asked me,
I said the same—that I would name no
names, and so I stick to the same resolution,
and nothing more shall be torn from me, not
if you were to tear me to pieces with a chain
harrow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come without,” said the captain, “and
you shall hear from me how it came to pass.
We must spare your mother’s feelings. She
was not in fault, she was wickedly imposed
on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the mining captain moved to the
door; Giles Inglett opened, and stood aside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>to allow his reputed father to go through;
then he followed him and shut the door behind
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Half an hour passed. Mrs. Saltren remained
for some minutes seated where she
had been, consoling herself with the reflection
that she had named no names; and that, if
mischief came of this, the fault would attach
to Saltren, not to her. A little while ago we
said that love was blind, hymeneal love most
blind; but blind with incurable ophthalmia,
blindest of all blindness, is self-love.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Saltren rose and went about her
domestic affairs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No one can charge me,” said she, “with
having kept my house untidy, or with having
left unmended my husband’s clothes. To
think of the cartloads of buttons I’ve put on
during my married life! It is enough to
convince any but the envious. Well, it is a
comfort that Stephen has been brought to
his senses at last, and come to view matters
in a proper light. I’ve heard James say that
there is a nerve goes from each eyeball into
the brain, and afore they enter it they take a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>twist about each other, and, so coupled,
march in together. And James said if it
were not so we should see double, and
neither eye would agree with the other. I
mind quite well that he said this one day
when I was complaining to him that Stephen
and I didn’t get on quite right together.
He said we’d get our twist one day and then
see all alike. What he said is come true;
leastways, the proper twist has come in
Stephen. Thank God, I always see
straight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She went to a corner cupboard and opened
it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now that Stephen is gone,” she said,
“I’ll rinse out the glass James had for his
gin-and-water. Saltren is that crazy on
teetotalism that he would be angry if he
knew I had given James any, and angry to
think I kept spirits in the house; and because
he is so stupid I’m obliged to put it in
a medicine-bottle with ‘For outward application
only’ on it, and say it is a lotion for neuralgia.
It is a mercy that I named no names,
so my conscience is clear. It is just as in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Egypt, when there was darkness over all the
land, the Israelites had light in their dwellings.
I thank goodness I’ve always the
clearest of light in me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She removed the tumbler and washed it in
the back kitchen.</p>

<p class='c005'>“When one comes to consider it, after all,
Stephen isn’t so very much out in his reckoning.
When does a nobleman take a delicate
lad out of a school and send him to a warm
climate because his lungs are affected, and
then give him scholarship and college
education, without having something that
makes him do it? Are there no other delicate
lads with weak lungs besides Giles?
Why did not his lordship send them to
Bordighera? Are there no other clever
young fellows in national schools besides my
boy, to be taken up and pushed on? There
must have been some reason for my lord
selecting Giles. Was it because I had been
in service in the house? Other young
women out of the park have married and
had children, but I never heard of my lord
doing anything for their sons. None of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>them have been sent to college and made
into gentlemen except my boy. But then I
was uncommonly good-looking, that is true,
and not another young hussey at the park
was fit to hold a candle to me. Though, the
Lord knows, I never set store on good looks.
If it pleases his lordship to treat Giles almost
as if he were a son, he has a right to do so,
but he must take the consequences. I don’t
interfere with the fancies of others, but if any
one chooses to do a queer thing, he must
expect to have to answer for it. I have no
doubt that his lordship has frequently wished
he had a son, such a fine and handsome
fellow as my Giles, and for some years he
was without any son of his own to inherit his
title. There was only Miss Arminell.
Anyhow, no responsibility attaches to me,
whatever may be said. No one can blame
me. His lordship ought never to have taken
notice of Giles, never to have had the doctor
examine his lungs, and, when told that the
boy would die unless sent to the south of
France, he should have said, ‘He is the son
of poor parents, who can’t afford the expense,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>so I suppose he must die.’ No one could
have blamed him, then. And when Giles
came back—better, but still delicate, and not
suited to do hard work—my lord should not
have sent him to school and college, and
taken him in at Orleigh Park as tutor to his
son—he should not have done any of these
things unless he had made up his mind to
take the consequences. Scripture says that
no man sets down to build a tower without
having first counted the cost. It is not at all
unlikely that folks will say queer things, and
I know for certain my husband thinks queer
fancies about my boy and Lord Lamerton;
but who is to blame for that? If his lordship
didn’t want to make it thought by all the
world that Giles was his son, all I can say is,
he shouldn’t have done for him what he did.
It is not my place to stop idle talk. I’d like
to know whether it is any woman’s duty to
run about a parish correcting the mistakes
made by the gossiping tongues therein. I
thank heaven I am not a gadabout. I do
my duty, washing, and ironing, and mending
of waistcoats, and sewing on of buttons, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>darning of stocking-feet, and baking of meat-dumplings,
and peeling of potatoes; that is
what my work is, and I do it well. I don’t
take upon me the putting to rights of other
folks when in error. Every one stands for
himself. If you cut the wick crooked you
must expect your chimney-glass to get
smoked, and, if Lord Lamerton has snipped
his wick askew, he must look out for fish-tails.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Saltren removed her petroleum lamp-glass,
struck a match, and proceeded slowly
to light her lamp.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I remember James telling me once, how
that he had been in France, I think he called
it La Vendée, where the fields are divided
by dykes full of stagnant water; and one of
the industries of the place is the collecting of
leeches. The men roll up their breeches
above the knee and carry a pail, and wade in
the ditches, and now and again throw up a
leg, and sweep off two, three, or it may be a
dozen leeches from the calf into the pail.
Then they wade further, and up with a leg
again and off with a fresh batch of leeches.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>I haven’t been in a big house, and seen the
ways of the aristocracy, and not found out
that they are waders in leech dykes, and that
it is as much as they can do to keep their
calves clear, and their blood from being
sucked out of them altogether. Now what I
want to know is, if a starved leech does bite,
and suck and swell, and is not wiped off and
sent to market, but gets reg’lar blown out
with blood, hasn’t that leech a right to say
that he has in him the blood of the man to
whom he has attached himself? I’d ask any
independent jury whether my Giles Inglett
has eaten and drunk more at Saltren’s expense,
or at that of his lordship, whether he
does not owe his very life to his lordship as
much as to me, for he’d have died of decline,
if he had not been sent to the South? And
if he owes his life to Lord Lamerton equally
as he does to me, and has been fed and
clothed, and educated by him and not by
Saltren, why then, like the leech, he can say
he has the blood of the Lamertons in him.
That is common sense. And again—bother
that lamp!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Mrs. Saltren in place of turning the wick
up, had turned it down, and was obliged to
remove the chimney and strike another
match.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And then,” she continued, “if Lord
Lamerton has not chose to wipe him off into
the pail, who is to blame but himself? If he
choose to keep his leg in a leech pond, there’s
neither rhyme nor reason in my objecting;
and he has no claim to cry out. Put Giles
on a plate, and sprinkle salt on him, and
whose blood will come out? Any one can
see he is a gentleman! He has imbibed it
all, his manners, his polish, his knowledge,
everything he has, from Lord Lamerton and
others, all the world can see it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then in came the young man about whom
she was arguing with herself. He could not
speak, so great was his agitation, but he went
to his mother, and threw his arms about her,
clasped her to his heart, and kissed her. For
some time he could not say anything, but
after a while he conquered his emotion sufficiently
to say—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, my mother—my poor mother! Oh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>my dear, my ill-used mother!” and then again
his emotions got the better of him. “I
cannot,” he said, after a pause, with a renewed
effort to govern himself, “I cannot
say what I shall do now, I cannot even think,
but I am sure of one thing, I must remain no
longer at the park.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My boy!” exclaimed Mrs. Saltren.
“Fall off yourself into the plate and salt!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not understand,” said he. She left
him in his ignorance, she had been thinking
of the leeches.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Giles! Whatever you do,
don’t breathe a word of this to any one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mother, I will not, you may be sure of
that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not to Lord Lamerton above all—not
for heaven’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Least of all to him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should get into such trouble. Oh, my
gracious!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mother, dear,” the young fellow clasped
her to his heart again—“how inexpressibly
precious you are to me now, and how I
grieve for you. I can say no more now.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Then he went forth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, bless me!” exclaimed Mrs. Saltren.
“He never was so affectionate before.
Well, as far as human reason goes, it does
seem as if all things were being brought to
their best for me; for this day has given me
my husband’s love and doubled that of my
son.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles Inglett Saltren walked hastily back
to the park. On his way he encountered
Samuel Ceely, who put forth his maimed
hand, and crooked the remaining fingers in
his overcoat, to arrest him, as he went by.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you want with me?” asked
Jingles impatiently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should be so glad if you would put in a
word for me,” pleaded the old man.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am engaged—I cannot wait.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,” urged old Ceely, without letting
go his hold, “Joan has axed Miss Arminell
for a scullery-maid’s place for me. Now I’d
rather have to do wi’ the dogs, or I could
keep the guns beautifully clean, or even the
stables.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I really cannot attend to this!” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Jingles, impatiently. “I have other matters
of more importance now on my mind; besides,
my influence is not what—” he spoke
bitterly—“what it should be in the great
house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You might do me a good turn, and speak
a word for me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The probability of my speaking a good
word for you, or any one to Lord Lamerton,
or of doing any one a good turn in Orleigh
Park, is gone from me for ever,” said Giles.
“You must detain me no longer—it is useless.
Let me go.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He shook himself free from the clutch of
the old man, and walked along the road.</p>

<p class='c005'>After he had gone several paces, perhaps
a hundred yards, he turned—moved by what
impulse was unknown to him—and looked
back. In the road, lit by the moon, stood
the cripple, stretching forth his maimed hand
after him, with the claw-like fingers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XVIII.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>HOW ARMINELL TOOK IT.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Giles Inglett Saltren walked on fast, he
was disturbed in the stream of his thoughts
by the interruption of the tiresome old
cripple. He had more important matters
to occupy his mind than the requirements
of Samuel Ceely. His heart beat, his hands
became moist. What a marvellous disclosure
had been made to him—and he
wondered at himself for not having divined
it before. He argued much as did his
mother. Why had Lord Lamerton done
such great things for him, why had he sent
him abroad, found him money, given him
education, lifted him far above the sphere
in which his parents moved, unless he felt
called to do so by a sense of responsibility,
such as belongs to a father?</p>

<p class='c005'>To a whole class of minds disinterested
conduct is inconceivable. All such conduct
as is oblique is to them intelligible, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>allowance is made by them for stupidity,
and stupidity with them is the same thing as
unselfishness. But such unselfishness is
permissible only by fits as lapses from the
course which all men naturally take. But
that men should act consistently on disinterested
motives is an idea too preposterous
for them to allow of its existence.</p>

<p class='c005'>This class of minds does not belong
specially to any particular stratum of society,
though it is found to be most prevalent
where the struggle for existence is most
keen, and where there is least culture.</p>

<p class='c005'>But of culture there are two kinds, that
which is external, and that which is within;
it is generally found that this inability to
understand disinterested conduct is found
everywhere where the inner culture does
not exist.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is, we believe, a Rabbinic legend
concerning a certain cow which was its own
calf, and much disputation ensued among
the Talmudists, to determine the point of
time at which the cow calved itself, and when
it ceased to be accounted beef, and became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>veal, or the contrary. But what seems to
us Gentiles to be impossible in the material
sense, is possible enough in the spiritual
realm, and a very calf-like self may become
the mother of a cow-self, so vast, so considerable
that, like the Brahminic cow,
Varuna, it will occupy the entire firmament,
extend to the horizon on all sides, and overshadow
and envelope everything. Varuna
in fact is the universe, and as we see and
exist in that universe, so with the cow-self
born of calf-self, it becomes our universe.
We see only that cow, inhale the breath
of that cow, think only cow thoughts,
stand on cow, and our aspirations are
limited on all sides by cow. That cow is
Self born of self. The breath of that cow is
sweet to our nostrils, its milk the nourishment
of our bowels, its low is music to our
ears, and nothing that does not smell and
taste and sound of that cow is worthy of
being smelt, and tasted, and listened to.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of this cow we can give information unattainable
by the Rabbis. We can watch its
development, if we cannot determine the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>moment of its nativity. It probably comes
to the birth at an early age, but there is this
deserving of consideration about it that this
cow born of calf can be bled to whiteness,
and knocked on the head if taken in time.</p>

<p class='c005'>If, however, it be allowed to attain to
heiferhood, it is thenceforth unmanageable;
we see everything through its medium, and
like and dislike, love and hate all objects and
persons as they stand within or without of
the compass of the great cow-self, which has
become our Varuna, our universe.</p>

<p class='c005'>It must not be supposed that such as live
under the shadow of this great cow, are oppressed
by it. On the contrary they have
become so accustomed to it that they could
not exist apart from it. There is a story of
a man who carried a monstrous cow on his
shoulders, and explained that he had acquired
the ability to do so by beginning
with the creature when it was a day old. As
the calf grew, so grew his ability to support
its weight. It is the same with us, we
carry the little calf-self about on our shoulder,
and dance along the road and leap over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>stones, and as day by day the calf grows, so
does our capacity for carrying it, till at last
we trudge about everywhere, into all society,
even into church, with the monstrous cow-self
on our shoulders, and do not feel that we
have anything weighing on us whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Giles Inglett Saltren had grown up
nursing and petting this calf. He had good
natural abilities, but partly through his
mother’s folly, partly through external circumstances,
he had come to see everything
through a medium of self. The notice taken
of him by his schoolmaster because he was
intelligent, by Lord Lamerton because he
was delicate, the very stethoscoping of his
lungs, the jellies and grapes sent him from
the great house, the petting he got in the
servants’ hall, because he was handsome and
interesting, the superiority he had acquired
over his parents by his residence abroad, and
education, all tended to the feeding and
fattening of the calf-self; and the cod-liver
oil he had consumed, had not merely gone to
restore his lungs, but to build up piles of
yellow fat on the flanks of self. Jingles had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>already reached that point at which his cow
had become Varuna, his entire universe.
He thought of, considered, nothing from any
other point of view than as it touched
himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>His consciousness of discomfort in the
society at Orleigh, his bitterness of mood,
his resentment of the distinctions not purposely
made, but naturally existing and
necessarily insuperable, between himself and
those with whom he associated, all this
sprang out of the one source, all came of the
one disease—intense, all-absorbing, all prevailing
selfishness.</p>

<p class='c005'>He observed the natural ease that pervaded
all the actions of those with whom he
was brought into contact in the upper world,
and their complete lack of self-consciousness,
their naturalness, simplicity, in all they said
and did. He had not got it—he could not
acquire it, he was like a maid-of-all work
from a farmhouse on a market day in the
county town wearing a Mephistopheles hat
on her red head, and ten-button gloves on
her mottled arms. He was conscious of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>self-consciousness—he feared it would be
remarked. It made him suspicious and
envious and angry. He could not reach to
the ease of those above him, and therefore
he desired to level them to his own plane.
A man with black blood in his veins is fearful
lest those at the table should look at his
nails. Jingles was ever dreading lest some
chance glance should discover the want of
breed in himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>This caused him much misery; and this all
came of his carrying about the cow-self with
him into my lady’s boudoir, and my lord’s
study, to the dining-room, and to the parlour.</p>

<p class='c005'>I was at the autumn fair some years ago
at Liège; on the boulevards were streets of
booths, some for the sale of cakes and toys,
others shows; but, as among the stalls those
for cakes prevailed, so among the shows did
the Rigolade Parisienne preponderate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not having the faintest conception of what
the Rigolade was, I paid my sou and entered
one in quest of knowledge; and this is what
I saw—a series of mirrors. But there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>this peculiar about the mirrors, one was
convex, and in it I beheld my nose reduced
to a pimple, and my eyes to currants; another
was concave, in which my nose swelled
to a proboscis and my eyes to plums. A
third mirror multiplied my face fifty times.
A fourth showed me my face elongated, as
when my MS. has been returned “not
suited,” from an editor; a fifth widened my
face to an absurd grin; in a sixth I saw my
pleasant self magnified in serene and smiling
beauty in the midst, and showed me every
surrounding person and object, the faces of
men, the houses, the cathedral, the sky, the
sun, all distorted out of shape and proportions.
“Eh ça, M’sou,” said the showman,
“c’est la véritable Rigolade Parisienne.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Eh ça—my dear readers, was Giles Inglett
Saltren’s vision of life. He saw himself, infinitely
magnified, and everything else dwarfed
about him and tortured into monstrosity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of one thing I am very certain, dear
reader, in this great Rigolade of life into
which we have entered, and through which
we are walking, there are some who are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>always seeing themselves in the multiplying
mirror, and there are others who contemplate
their faces continually elongated, whilst
others again see themselves in the widening
mirror and accommodate themselves to be the
perpetual buffoon. Let us trust that these
are not many, but there certainly are some
who view themselves enlarged, and view
everything and every person beside, the
world about them, the heaven above them,
in a state of distortion.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton had shown the young
tutor extraordinary kindness, for he was a
man with a soft heart, and he really wished
to make the young fellow happy. He would
have liked Giles to have opened out to him
and not to have maintained a formal distance,
but he was unable to do more than
invite confidence, and he attributed the stiffness
of the tutor to his shyness. Of late, his
lordship had begun to think that perhaps
Jingles was somewhat morbid, but this he
attributed to his constitutional delicacy.
Consumptive people are fantastical, was his
hasty generalization.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>In the heart of Giles Inglett Saltren a
very mixed feeling existed as he walked
back to the park. He was gratified to
think that he had noble blood in his veins,
but he was incensed at the thought of the
treachery to which his mother had fallen a
victim, and which robbed him of his birth-rights.
Had that function in the drawing-room,
described by his mother, been celebrated
legally, he and not the snivelling
little Giles would be heir to Orleigh, to fifty
thousand a year, and a coronet, and a seat in
the House of Lords. What use would Giles
the Little make of his privileges? Would
he not lead the same prosaic life as his
father, planting pines, digging fish-ponds,
keeping a pack of hounds, doing the active
work of a county magnate and magistrate—whereas
he—Giles Inglett Saltren, no longer
Saltren, but Baron Lamerton of Orleigh,
might become, with the advantages of his
birth, wealth, and abilities combined, the
greatest statesman and reformer England
had known. He felt that his head was
bursting with ideas, his blood on fire to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>them utterance, and his hands tingling to
carry his projects into effect. Without some
adventitious help, such as position and
wealth could give, he could not take the
place he knew by inner illumination should
be his.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was sure of it,” said Jingles, “that is to
say I imagined that I could not be the son of
a common mining captain. There was something
superior to that sort of stuff in me.
But now this infamous act of treachery stands
between me and acknowledgment by the
world, between me and such success as, perhaps
no man in England, except perhaps Mr.
Gladstone, has attained to. All I want is a
lift on the ladder—after that first step I will
mount the rest of the way myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He walked on fast. His blood seethed in
his heart. He was angry with Lord Lamerton
for having betrayed his mother’s trust,
and with his mother for allowing herself to
be deceived.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Something may yet be done. It is not impossible
that I may discover what has not
been suspected. I must discover this friend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>who pretended to be a parson, and search
the archiepiscopal registers for the alleged
licence. It is hardly likely, that my lord
would dare to fabricate a false licence, or for
a friend of his to run the risk, out of friendship,
of twenty-five years’ penal servitude.
No—it is, calmly considered, far more likely
that a true licence was obtained, that the
marriage though secret, was valid, and that
my mother was imposed upon, when assured
she had been duped, and then she was forced
on Captain Saltren to dispose of her securely
against discovering her rights and demanding
them. I will go to town and then take advice
what to do. It will, perhaps, be best
for me thence to write to his lordship and
ask for the particulars, threatening unless
they are furnished me voluntarily, that I will
search them out for myself. If I were the
Honourable Giles Inglett,” mused Jingles,
with his eyes on the moonlit road, “how
utterly different my position in the house
would be to what it now is. That confounded
butler—who assumes a patronising
air, and would, if I gave him encouragement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>pat me on the shoulder. That impudent
valet, who brought me up the wrong waistcoat
yesterday morning and allowed me to
ring thrice before he chose to answer the
bell, and never apologised for having kept
me waiting. Then, again, at table the other
day, when something was said of fish out
of water, the footman touched my back with
the dish of curried prawns. He did it intentionally,
he meant that I was a fish out of
water, a curried prawn myself, in fiery heat.
There was something said among the gentlemen
about Gammon, the man who has just
been created High Sheriff. He made his
money in mines. One of those present said
that those fellows who scramble into society
for which they are not qualified always reminded
him of French poodles, half-shaven and half-savage;
every one laughed and the laugh
cut me like knives. I am sure several at the
table thought of me, and that they have taken
to calling to me ‘the French poodle.’ What
am I? I am either his lordship’s legitimate
but unacknowledged son—and if so I am
shaved all over; but if I am as he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>pretend, his bastard—I am half-shaved, and so
half-shaved I must run about the world,
laughed at, thought monstrous, pitied, a creature
of aristocratic and plebeian origin commingled,
with the hair about my neck, and
ears, and eyes, and nose, but all the rest of
me polished and cultured. A poodle indeed!
I—a French poodle!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A piece of decayed branch fallen from a
tree lay in the road. Jingles kicked it away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That,” said he passionately, “is what I
should like to do to the butler, were I the
Honourable Giles. And that,” he kicked
another stick, “is how I would treat that
brute who allowed me to wait for my waistcoat.
And so,” he trod on and snapped a
twig that lay athwart his path, “so would I
crush the footman who dared to nudge me
with the curried prawns! And,” he caught
a hazel bough that hung from the hedge, and
broke it off, and ripped the leaves away, and
then with his teeth pulled the rind away,
“and this is what I would do to that man
who dared to talk of half-shaved French
poodles. Oh! if I could be but a despot—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>dictator for an hour—for an hour only—to
ram the curried prawns down the throat of
that insolent ruffian who nudged me, and to
flay alive that creature who spoke of poodles!
Then I would cheerfully surrender my power
into the hands of the people and be the democratic
leader once more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He entered the park grounds by a side-gate
and was soon on the terrace. There he
saw Arminell returning to the house from her
stroll in the avenue.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Saltren,” she said, “have you also
been enjoying the beauty of the night?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been trying to cool the fever within,”
he replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope,” she said, misunderstanding him,
“that you have not caught the influenza, or
whatever it is from Giles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have taken nothing from Giles. The
fever I speak of is not physical.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! you are still thinking of what we
discussed over the Noah’s Ark.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—how can I help it? I who am
broken and trodden on at every moment.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sorry to hear you say this, Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Saltren. I also have been talking the matter
over with papa, and after he went in, I have
been walking up and down under the trees
meditating on it—but I get no farther, for all
my thinking.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Inglett,” said Jingles, “the time of
barley-mows is at an end. Hitherto we have
had the oats, and the wheat, and the rye,
and the clover, and the meadow-grass ricked,
stacked separately. All that is of the past.
The age of the stack-yard is over with its
several distinct classified ricks—this is wheat,
that is rye; this is clover, that damaged hay.
We are now entering an age of Silo, and inevitably
as feudalism is done away with, so
will the last relics of distinctions be swept
aside also, and we shall all enter an universal
and common silo.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not think I quite understand you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Henceforth all mankind will make one,
all contribute to the common good, all be
pressed together and the individuality of one
pass to become the property of all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell shook her head and laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I confess that I find great sweetness in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the old stack-yard, and a special fragrance
attaches to each rick. Is all that to be a
thing of the past, and the savour of the silo
to be the social atmosphere of the future?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You strain the illustration,” said Saltren
testily.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You wish to substitute an aggregate of
nastiness for diversified sweets.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Inglett, I will say no more. I
thought you more sympathetic with the aspirations
of the despised and down-trodden,
with the movement of ideas in the present
century.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sympathetic,” said Arminell. “But
I am as bewildered now as I was this morning.
I am just as one who has been spun
through the spiral tunnel on the St. Gothard
line, when one rushes forth into day; you
know neither in which direction you are going,
nor to what level you are brought. I dislike
your similitude of a silo, and so have a right
to criticise it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Arminell,” said Jingles, standing still.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Saltren!” The girl reared herself
haughtily, and spoke with icy coldness.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>“Exactly,” laughed the tutor, bitterly. “I
thought as much! You will not allow the
presumed son of a manganese captain, the
humble tutor, to presume an approach of
familiarity to the honourable the daughter of
a peer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I allow no one to presume,” said she,
haughtily, and turned her back on him, and
resumed her walk.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet I have a right,” pursued Jingles,
striding after her. “Miss Inglett—Arminell
listen to me. I am not the man to presume.
I know and am made to feel too sharply my
inferiority to desire to take a liberty. But I
have a right, and I stand on my right. I
have a right to call you by your Christian
name, a right which you will acknowledge.
I am your brother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell halted, turned and looked at him
from head to foot with surprise mingled with
disdain.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You doubt my words,” he went on. “I
am not offended—I am not surprised at that;
indeed, I expected it. But what I say is
true. We have different mothers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>mine”—with bitterness—“of the people, that I allow—of
the people, of the common, base lot,
who are dirt under your feet; yours is of the
aristocracy, made much of, received in society,
in the magic circle from which mine would
be shut out. But we have one father; I
stand to you in precisely the same relation as
does the boy Giles, but I am your elder
brother, and should be your adviser and
closest friend.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
